The sudden inundation of a city north of Tokyo this week when a river swollen by torrential rains broke through flood embankments was a relatively rare occurrence in Japan, a country with one of the world's most elaborate water-control systems. Here is a look at the disaster and its implications: A section of an embankment along the Kinugawa River, a tributary of one of the major rivers in the Tokyo region, the Tone, gave way Thursday, allowing the water to surge into the surrounding valley. Many residents who had not heeded warnings to flee were stranded atop roofs and vehicles as the waters rose around them. Authorities said 22 people were missing. WHY DID THE RIVER FLOOD
For one, a lot of rain. Government data show that the amount of water entering the river system due to the unusually heavy rainfall caused four upstream dams to reach capacity in only a few hours, limiting their effectiveness for flood control.The relatively steep grade and narrow river bed in the worst-hit city of Joso also raised the risk of flooding. A flood hazard map for Joso shows risks of flooding up to three stories high in much of the valley. The levees along the Kinugawa were due to be reinforced, but work hadn't begun yet.EVACUATION DELAYS. While tens of thousands of people were instructed to evacuate, many more received only a ""recommendation"" to leave and many stayed put. That's typical. In Japan, many ignore evacuation warnings, other than the elderly and the infirm, who are not able to escape quickly. HISTORICAL FACTORS. The name ""Kinugawa"" means ""river of an angry demon."" It has flooded repeatedly over the centuries. In 1938 more than 300 people died in a flood brought on by a typhoon. Japan's rulers ordered a change to the river's course in the 17th century as part of a larger project to divert the Tone River away from Tokyo Bay and further east, directly into the Pacific.? 2015 The Associated Press.

Japan has put heavy emphasis on disaster prevention since a 2011 earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people and authorities are keen to avoid criticism for what was seen as a sluggish response. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned of more rain and said he was setting up an emergency centre. ""The government will work as one to prioritise the safety of the people and do our best to prevent any further disaster,"" Mr Abe told reporters. Television footage showed people in Joso waving towels while waiting for help on the upper floors of homes engulfed in floods after the overflowing Kinugawa river swept through. ""I thought I was safe because I live on a hill, but pretty soon the water came up and everything was washed away,"" a barefoot man told Fuji TV after his helicopter rescue.
Up to 12 military helicopters took part in the rescue along with an initial 55 members of Japan's military, the Self Defence Force. Officials said their number would rise. Rescue workers rushed to find people before nightfall. Part of a hotel in the town of Nikko, famed for its shrines and temples, had collapsed, Kyodo news agency said, but there were no reports of injuries. Rainfall reached 500 millimetres around Joso, NHK said, with weather officials expecting at least 200 millimetres more in parts of eastern Japan, including Fukushima, the site of the nuclear reactor crippled in 2011, before the downpour stops on Friday.""TC-2015-000124-JPN Tropical Cyclone,Japan: Typhoon Etau made landfall on 9 September in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan bringing heavy rain and strong winds.

In a report issued last week, UN?s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Niger said that recent floods that began in late July have affected over 20,000 people and left at least 4 dead.OCHA say that over 2,000 homes and over 500 hectares of farm land have been destroyed. Currently over 3,000 people are living in temporary homes or camps. Seven regions have been affected; Agadez, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillab‚ri and Zinder, where almost 7,000 are affected.The Niger River poses a severe flood threat across wide areas of the country, including the capital Niamey. OCHA report that river levels currently stood at 580 cm on 05 August 2015 ? above the alert level of 530 cm. OCHA say that flood defences have been built up to 650 cm. Severe floods can be expected should river levels rise above this. Authorities have asked residents living near the edge of the Niger River to leave their homes because of the flood threat.Over the least few weeks severe flooding has also struck in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, and also Guinea.Niger regularly suffers from flooding during this time of year. During August and September 2014, 38 people were killed and 60,000 affected by floods. The worst hit region was Tillab‚ry, followed by Dosso, Maradi and Tahoua. An outbreak of cholera during the following months was partly attributed to the floods.In 2013, torrential rain in August resulted in flooding that killed 32 people. The worst affected regions were Maradi, Tillabery, Dosso, Tahoua, Niamey and Zinder.The region of Diffa, home to thousands of refugees who have fled violence in neighbouring Nigeria, is unaffected by the current floods.

After the worst flooding to hit the city in decades, the tents aren?t just a refuge from the murky water below, they?re also a good idea if you want to ensure no one helps themselves to your belongings.The sun is shining again in the Pampas. The Luj n, Salado and Arrecifes river basins are finally receding after weeks of torrential rain filled them three or four times above their normal levels. More than 10,000 evacuees from around the province are returning home. They will not be able to simply resume their lives as before. If not lost entirely, their properties will be severely damaged, and they face the added challenge of keeping their families healthy in far from sanitary conditions.Guillermo has pitched his tent on the mud a few metres away from his inundated house, on higher ground next to the railroad. He is living in it with his two oldest children while they wait for his wife and little baby to return. They are staying at a shelter ?until it dries up and it?s safe for them to come back,? he explains.He smiles bitterly as he tells IRIN how his television was washed away. ?What the water doesn?t steal, stray hands will,? goes the oft-heard expression during these floods. Guillermo, like many others, is leaving nothing to chance and is staying put so nothing else is lost.The government and NGOs are hard at work trying to get people?s lives back on track. Local official Andrea Bozzini tells IRIN that every family has been given a special kit to help them start the clean-up process. The government will also continue to distribute meals, drinking water, blankets and other basic necessities in the coming days, she says.By Sunday morning only 68 of the 500 or so evacuees remain in the two official shelters in Mercedes. They are all women and children planning to return after lunch to celebrate the end of Argentina?s Children?s Day in their own homes.The next weeks and months will not be easy for many, especially in the poorer neighbourhoods that suffered the most damage. Here, people with limited means will struggle to recover any time soon. ?I cannot afford another week off work,? says Hern n. The construction worker is forlorn. He had been about to build a new more robust house for his family, but all his materials, like his home, were washed away in the flood.The government has announced an increase in pensions and welfare payments for those affected, as well as extra tax credits and exemptions. This is something at least, but for those who have lost everything, it is little recompense.In early August, more rain fell in just two days in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe than normally falls in an entire month. Worst-hit were the cities of Luj n, Mercedes, Salto, Lobos, Areco and Arrecifes. Floodwaters in the middle of town reached a height of 1.8 metres in some cases. At least three people died, more than 10,000 were evacuated and 20,000 affected.More than 10,000 people were evacuated from the province
Mercedes suffered its worst flooding since 1985. The civil defense authority received its first emergency calls as dawn broke on 10 August. By eight o?clock in the morning, there had been more than 100 requests for assistance. It was left to volunteer firefighters to rescue those trapped by the rapidly rising water. Strong currents made it impossible to use anything else but motorised boats. ?People know what to do when we arrive. They have learnt from previous catastrophes,? Alfredo Guti‚rrez, the deputy head of the firefighters, tells IRIN ironically.
Another firefighter, Sebasti n Cossi, recalls how difficult it was to reach those who had actually dialled in for help because the rescue teams kept finding other people in need along the way. After 15 hours, the teams had rescued some 200 people.
A sense of solidarity among ?dry citizens? developed quickly after the emergency became publicly known. NGOs, scout groups and national football clubs joined forces to collect and distribute donations in an amazing logistical effort. One group worthy of mention calls itself ?Friends of the Belgrano Railway.? They use carts on the rail system to access isolated areas, transporting both people and supplies around the stricken region.An important role is also being played by so-called ?organised individuals,? a campaign led by social media that sees ordinary Argentinians lend a hand in any way they can. Examples are countless. ?We couldn?t just watch it on TV,? says In‚s, a young professional from Mercedes who lives in the capital Buenos Aires. She and a group of friends arrived in Mercedes on Sunday morning with a lorry full of donated supplies.Although nature is obviously largely to blame, there is anger here too at what people percieve as official incompetence and corruption. The anger is particularly acute as this disaster comes just two years after more than 80 people died in similar flooding ? communities are left wondering why the lessons of past tragedy haven?t been learnt. Back in April 2013, the last time disaster struck, the region?s infrastructure, including drainage systems, was found wanting and yet little has been done to improve it. The risks of deforestation and urban development on floodplains without necessary environmental controls are equally well known and yet such practices have continued unabated.And, just as was the case a little more than two years ago, the politicians didn?t even wait for the floodwaters to recede before they started blaming each other for the disaster.To add a little extra spice this time around, the Governor of Buenos Aires province ? who rushed back from a trip to Italy after the scale of the crisis became clear ? is Daniel Scioli, frontrunner to succeed Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner as Argentina?s president after elections in October.The people of these fertile lowlands will be disappointed but not entirely surprised if the politicians? promises of investment and reform ? as well as the payoffs to the disaster victims ? dry up not long after the elections..""Argentina ? 3 Dead, 11,000 Evacuated after Floods in Buenos Aires and Santa Fe AUGUST 12, 2015 BY FLOODLIST NEWS IN AMERICAS7 Heavy rainfall in Argentina has resulted in flooding in provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe.Local authorities say at least 3 people have been killed and 11,000 people have evacuated their homes as a result of the flooding.

Tens of thousands of people remain stranded in Myanmar?s rugged and mountainous western border regions after relentless rains caused flash floods and triggered landslides swept away homes, roads and bridges.
The official death toll rose to 69 with more than 260,000 affected, Phyu Lei Lei Tun of the ministry of social welfare told AFP Wednesday.
The floods severed communications across large areas of the country, which is roughly the size of France.
But information is starting to filter back from remote regions where people are seeking food and shelter in monasteries, schools and mosques.The hilltop Chin state capital of Hakha, home to about 40,000 people, is still only accessible by helicopter a week after a series of landslides saw walls of saturated earth collapse onto homes and roads.""The mountainsides collapsed -- in some areas the whole hill collapsed in the flood,"" Jacob Thang, of the local rescue committee, told AFP by telephone.About 6,600 people were taking refuge in temporary shelters either too afraid to go home, or with no house to return to, according to Thang.

When flash flooding hit, a Southern California bridge failed, after storm water eroded away the land on which the bridge was anchored. The scary situation developed late Sunday in the deserts east of Palm Springs, California, where the eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 were washed away by floodwaters near the town of Desert Center, according to the California Highway Patrol. At least one person was transported to a Palm Springs hospital after being trapped in a vehicle during the incident. Officials were concerned that the westbound lanes may have been undermined by the flooding, and the freeway remains closed.""Interstate 10 is closed completely and indefinitely,"" Terri Kasinga, spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, told the Associated Press Monday morning.In 2014, the National Bridge Inventory listed the eastbound lanes of the Tex Wash Bridge as ""functionally obsolete,"" according to a Desert Sun report. The bridge was built in 1967 and was considered ""no longer adequate for its task, though it was not listed as having known structural problems that needed to be fixed,"" the report added. The westbound bridge, built the same year, was labeled ""not deficient,"" the Desert Sun also found.One of the proposed detour routes, State Route 78, was also closed from Brawley to Palo Verde when it was flooded a short time later, damaging the eastbound lanes. Arizona officials advised residents to use Interstate 8 to get to southern California's major coastal cities.Nine inspectors fanned out Throughout the day Monday, nine state inspectors fanned out to check all 44 bridges along a 20-mile stretch of I-10 after a second bridge showed signs of damage following the storm Sunday, according to Caltrans. They also planned to inspect bridges across the large swath of Southern California where the remnants of a tropical storm dumped unusual July deluges, the AP reported.""This is a fascinating situation on so many levels. Against a backdrop of climate change, with the global atmosphere setting heat records month after month, we have an El Ni¤o warming the waters of the tropical eastern Pacific. On top of that, the waters off the U.S. West Coast are also far warmer than average, and we have a tropical storm moving farther north and closer to the Mexican coast than most others in the historical record this early in the season,"" said weather.com senior meteorologist Nick Wiltgen. Wiltgen added: ""So all of this is dragging rich tropical moisture into southern California, where rain is usually very scant in July ? and doing so in the midst of a historic drought, no less. It's almost surreal to watch it unfold if you know the back story.""Additional state-by-state impacts are below. California All lanes of Interstate 15 were blocked near the Cajon Junction late Sunday afternoon when a mudflow slid across the highway, the National Weather Service reported, citing the California Highway Patrol. Late Friday, the area was impacted by a massive brush fire that burned near the interstate in Cajon Pass. Sunday night, a large pothole developed in the right lane of northbound Interstate 5 north of Castaic, according to CHP reports. Several vehicles suffered flat tires from the pothole, which grew to 3 feet in diameter and also caused a six-vehicle collision.At least six homes in Moreno Valley were flooded with mud and water late Sunday afternoon, ABC 7 Los Angeles reported. Authorities performed at least one water rescue.Jennifer Fuhrman of the Riverside County Fire Department told NBC Los Angeles the muck came from mountains that rise above the affected area. Several vehicles stalled in the flood waters.Sunday's rainfall was also notable in the sports world. The Los Angeles Angels experienced their first home rainout since 1995 when Sunday night's game against the Boston Red Sox was postponed.

On Sunday, at least 15 of Calasiao?s 24 barangays were reported to be under water.Floodwaters came from the Marusay River, the downstream of the Sinocalan and Tagamusing Rivers that come from Mount Ampucao in Benguet province. The waterway cuts through the town and passes through Dagupan City before draining into the Lingayen Gulf. On Sunday, Marusay was already 2.74 meters above its normal level and still rising, DRRMO chief Freddie Villacorta said.At least four people were reported to have died as a result of the rains, including 6-month-old RJ Orteras, who was buried by a landslide at Barangay Catungi in Bolinao, Pangasinan province, and Romeo Sunong, 13, who drowned in Zambales province, according to civil defense officials.

Although no storm was forecast, the government weather bureau warned that ?monsoon rains, which may trigger flash floods and landslides, will be experienced? over large areas of the northern part of Luzon. Heavy rain dumped by the southwest monsoon over the past five days flooded at least 190 villages in Luzon, including 100 in Pangasinan, the officials said. The southwest monsoon also whipped tornadoes in the Pangasinan towns of Sual and Anda, destroying 31 houses and triggering landslides in the towns of Bani and Bolinao. Swollen rivers breached dikes in Sta. Barbara, Binalonan and Lingayen. Bani Mayor Gwen Palafox Yamamoto said at least 200 families from her town?s 11 villages were taken to seven evacuation centers.
Yamamoto said 90 percent of the town?s agriculture area was destroyed while its aquaculture areas were under water, allowing the stocks to escape from the ponds. She said her town had been placed under a state of calamity. Dian Lovemore Carranza, DRRM officer in Bolinao, said some villages in his town were isolated because of at least 11 landslides. He said a bridge linking the villages of San Roque and Catuday collapsed. The water level at San Roque Dam in San Manuel town rose by almost 15 m in the last two days, officials said. Virgilio Garcia of state-owned National Power Corp. said the rain had filled up Ambuklao and Binga Dams in the upstream of the Agno River, prompting officials to open their spillway gates. But Garcia said there was no cause for alarm because San Roque Dam?s water level was still way below its maximum level. In the Cordillera, a section of Marcos Highway in Barangay Taloy Sur in Tuba, Benguet, was closed early Sunday after a landslide hit the area but a single lane was opened by midmorning, said the Office of Civil Defense.

Many more are thought to be missing.

June usually sees the start of Nepal?s monsoon. Nearly 130 mm of rain fell in the Taplejung between 10 and 11 June 2015, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Government of Nepal. The heavy rain has caused the Mewa and Tamor rivers to burst their banks and triggered landslides.

Local media say one landslide in Taplejung has affected the several villages, including Liwang, Thokling, Thinglabu and Lingket VDCs in Taplejung district.

The area is remote, and attempts by rescue and relief operations teams to reach the affected area have been hampered by poor weather.

Mapping Potential Landslide Sites

Although Taplejung was not severely affected by the devastating earthquake of April, research after the quake found that many slopes across Nepal remained unstable and vulnerable to landslides, and that the situation was likely to worsen with the onset of monsoon rains.

The threat of post-quake landslides in Nepal is so great that NASA is working on mapping potential locations. Last week, NASA announced that a team of international volunteers was working through satellite imagery of the earthquake-affected areas in Nepal to identify possible landslide locations.

?Landslides are a common secondary hazard triggered by earthquakes or rainfall,? said Dalia Kirschbaum, a remote sensing scientist at NASA?s Goddard Space Flight Center and a leader of a landslide mapping effort. ?Because landslides can mobilize and move so quickly, they often cause more damage than people realize.?

Scientists were using sources such as Landsat satellites, the Earth Observing-1 satellite, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument on the Terra satellite, the WorldView and GeoEye satellites operated by Digital Globe, and image mosaics and topographic information accessible in Google Earth.

In their statement, NASA said that mapping landslides is especially important because of the impending monsoon season in Nepal where the highest number of landslides occur. The team is providing information that Nepalese government, military, and scientific entities could use to make informed decisions about evacuations and relief support."

The Vere river burst its banks after torrential rain late on 13 June 2015. Emergency officials said that the flood situation was worsened by a landslide that blocked part of the river, causing a large volume of water to accumulate and then burst through the blockage, wreaking havoc in the Vake and Saburtalo neighbourhoods, both densely populated residential areas of the city further downstream.

Streets were turned into raging rivers of mud, with flood waters sweeping away vehicles and causing widespread damage to homes and property. Dozens of families have been made homeless as a result. Power supplies have been cut and public transport severely restricted. Apart from a few emergency and government offices, Tbilisi has been declared ?closed? today, Monday 15 June.

International media have picked up on the fact that the city?s zoo was also flooded, allowing dozens of animals, including wolves, tigers and lions, to escape and roam through the city?s streets. Georgia?s Ministry of Internal Affairs issued warnings to residents of Tbilisi to remain indoors until all animals had been found and returned to the zoo.

In 2010 the heavy rains in Benin created unexpected rising water levels that overwhelmed the country?s traditional preventive response and resilience mechanisms. As a results 278 schools were flooded and more than 50,000 houses were destroyed leaving 150,000 people without shelter. The 2010 floods ruined 128,000 hectares of crops and farmland and an estimated 12,000 metric tons of food stocks were lost because of destroyed storage facilities.

A Drainage Master Plan and a Solid Waste Management (SWM) Strategy was prepared under the original project in 2014. It revealed significant clogging in numerous points in the drainage system, which, if not treated, could bring about further flooding.

?An additional 94,000 people will no longer be subjected to periodic flooding with today?s new financing that will build on the original project and help improve and expand access to reliable drainage systems in poor areas of Benin,? says Ousmane Diagana, the World Bank?s Country Director for Benin."

Floods have been affecting Dar es Salaam and other regions of Tanzania, including Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga and Kagera, for the last 6 days.

Streets of Dar es Salaam have been under water after 85 mm of rain fell in 24 hours on 07 May 2015.
Local media say that Dar es Salaam Police have confirmed that at least 12 people have died in the floods. There are fears that more are still missing or unaccounted for. Further heavy rainfall yesterday is causing problems for authorities to fully assess the situation. A better picture of the damage caused by the floods will only become clearer once the flood waters start to recede. As quoted in IPP, Dar es Salaam Special Police Zone Commander, Suleiman Kova said:

?As the intensity of the rains reduces and the level of waters decreases, the effects of the floods are becoming more vivid,?

The worst affected areas in Dar es Salaam are said to be Kinondoni and Temeke. Both districts are affected by flooding on a regular basis. Last week, Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner called for those in the affected areas to move to safer areas.

In Kilimanjaro region, as many as 3,000 people have been displaced after floods destroyed houses near Arusha Chini town in the Moshi rural district.

The couple live near the headwaters of the Bishop Creek drainage system and say their property frequently floods. A roundabout built across from their house in 2007 only contributed to the problem, Ryan Autry says.O?Leary says by far the majority of homes experiencing flooding are houses built in flood-prone areas near drainage canals or in the Little River floodplain. Many of them, including the Autrys? house, were built before regulations were put into place to protect homeowners.?Unfortunately, there are some places where structures just should not be,?

Of the homeowners who live in a flood plain area, such as many on the northwest side of the city, as well as on the east side, and points beyond in rural Cleveland County areas, O?Leary says only about 10 to 15 percent have flood insurance.
?And most of those are people voluntarily choosing not to have it. They figure if it floods, they?ll just deal with it.

At least 6 people died after being swept away by flash floods in Virudhunagar District of Tamil Nadu on Sunday 17 May 2015. Two more victims are still missing.

The flash flood hit the area of the Sathuragiri Hills, near Watrap, about 80 km south west of Madurai city.

Several thousand pilgrims had gathered in the area to worship at the Sundara Mahalingam Temple. Hundreds were trapped by the floods and, according to eye witnesses, at least 8 people were swept away. Emergency teams managed to rescue those stranded and have also retrieved bodies of 6 of the victims.

Associated Press SALGAR, Colombia (AP) - An avalanche of mud and debris roared through an alpine town in western Colombia before dawn Monday, killing at least 58 people in a flash flood and mudslide triggered by heavy rains.Residents were stirred from bed in the dead of the night by a loud rumble and neighbors' shouts of ""The river! The river!"" as modestly built homes and bridges plunged into the Libordiana ravine. Survivors barely had enough time to gather their loved ones.""It was rocks and tree trunks everywhere,"" Diego Agudelo told The Associated Press, adding that never in 34 years living next to the ravine had he suspected such a tragedy was possible.""The river took out everything in its path,"" the construction worker said, including the back part of his home.The disaster hit around 3 a.m. local time (4 a.m. EDT; 0800 GMT) in the town of Salgar, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) southwest of Medellin.Dozens of rescuers supported by Black Hawk helicopters evacuated residents near the ravine for fear of another mudslide. A red fire truck could be seen hauling away several bodies, their bare feet dangling from an open trunk.President Juan Manuel Santos, who traveled to the town to oversee relief efforts, said several children lost their parents and the bodies of those killed needed to be transported to Medellin to be identified. As giant diggers were removing debris he vowed to rebuild the lost homes and provide shelter and assistance for the estimated 500 people affected by the calamity.""Nobody can bring back the dead ... but we have to handle this disaster as best we can to move forward,"" Santos said.By Monday evening, Carlos Ivan Marquez, head of the National Disasters Unit, said 58 people had been killed and 37 injured, adding that more than 31 homes had been destroyed and an undetermined number of people were missing.Colombia's rugged topography, in a seismically active area at the northern edge of the Andes, combined with shoddy construction practices, has made the country one of Latin America's most disaster-prone.

She said her brother was killed along with his children and grandchildren.""I said to my wife 'let's hold each and hope that God saves us,'"" said Jorge Quintero, a local resident, describing to RCN TV how he was trapped between two raging currents that had taken with it two homes on either side of his own. ""I know God gave us his hand because here we are, alive, still frightened, but alive.""The flooding destroyed the town's aqueduct and even areas in less hazardous zones experienced flooding. As a cautionary measure, electricity and other public services were suspended after several utility poles were knocked down.Authorities called on volunteers to send water, food supplies and blankets to cope with what they described as a humanitarian emergency.The town of 18,000 lies amid one of Colombia's major coffee-growing regions.

""We need to get them into better shelter immediately, and provide access to clean water and sanitation facilities, not only to make families more comfortable, but to also help ward off the outbreak of disease.""

The latest round of flooding, which started when three rivers that cross Antananarivo ? the Sisaony, Ikopa and Imamba ? burst their banks during a storm on 24 February, has left 19 people dead and an estimated 36,000 displaced, according to the National Office for the Management of Risks and Catastrophes (BNGRC in French). A further 40,000 people were displaced in 13 other districts. On Wednesday, BNGRC issued a new alert warning that a low-pressure system just off the island?s west coast was expected to bring more torrential rainfall to the central highlands region. Several neighbourhoods in Antananarivo remain braced for further flooding and landslides over the coming days.  The current flooding adds to the many challenges already facing the city in the wake of Tropical Storm Chedza, which caused 68 deaths and almost 80,000 displacements across Madagascar - over 16,000 in Antananarivo alone - during the weekend of 17 January. In the aftermath, several of the city?s public spaces, such as sports stadia, have been providing temporary shelter for the displaced. Antananarivo?s topography means the heavy rains have had varying impacts on different parts of the capital. While residents of lower lying areas like Soavina have had to contend with waist-high gushing waters, the city?s hillier areas have experienced landslides and significant infrastructural damage.  BNGRC has issued a warning for landslides in several locations. The agency?s staff have been going door-to-door warning residents in affected areas to examine their homes for cracks or other signs of damage."

Reuters/Ivan Alvarado Chilean emergency rescue workers are increasingly concerned about the fate of 125 people missing after a week of flash floods and mudslides in the Atacama region in the north of the country. At least 25 people are confirmed dead, and another 2,700 are homeless following the devastating floods that affected a total of 30,000 Chileans. The floods, which started on March 25, submerged entire towns and dislodged thousands of tons of dirt. The flooding is the worst the region has seen in 80 years.
President Michelle Bachelet canceled a visit to a regional summit and visited the area on Saturday to survey the damage, promising more relief on top of what has already been allocated for the emergency response. Her government declared a state of emergency and provided more than 100,000 vaccines for the flu, tetanus and hepatitis A, along with other hygiene supplies and food. They are also building shelters for the homeless.
?We stand with you, as we have from the beginning, and we will rebuild,? Bachelet said Saturday. ?It pains me to see my country in such a state. ? We will find a solution.? Experts believe it will take months just for the mud that leveled buildings and destroyed roads to wash away. Health authorities worry that metals from the dozens of mines that dot the region could have contaminated water and soil, which could lead to cases of gastrointestinal diseases, France24 reported. The flooding was caused by an unusual cold front that hit the Andes mountains and a rise in sea temperatures, dropping rain instead of snow in the mountains, which flowed to the communities below. The region is typically arid and contain's the world's driest desert.
 Massive boulders rolled down into towns, lodging themselves in homes along with tons of mud, which eventually hardened. Areas in Peru were also affected by heavy flooding and mudslides. At least eight people were killed and 25 were injured there.""""FL-2015-000027-CHL Flood Chile Torrential rains starting on 25 Mar 2015 in a normally parched Atacama region of northern Chile triggered widespread flooding that left at least four people dead and 22 missing, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency.

[This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations."" ]January 9, 2015: "" BY RICHARD DAVIES IN AFRICA, NEWS. Heavy rainfall in parts of south east Africa over the last 2 weeks has resulted in flooding in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique.As reported earlier this week, as many as 10 people have died in flooding in Zimbabwe. According to media reports, 6 people have been killed in Malawi and as many as 9 people have died as a result of recent severe weather in Mozambique. Heavy rainfall has also been reported in Madagascar and Zambia although no flooding has as yet been reported.Change in Monsoon ? Rainfall 150% Higher Than NormalAccording to a report (pdf) on Africa Hazards Outlook by NOAA?s Climate Prediction Center, the heavy rainfall is a result of a change of the southern Africa Monsoon. The report says:?Since late December, the character of the southern Africa monsoon has shifted considerably, as several regions of southeastern Africa continue to experience a significant increase in rains and available ground moisture. This increase has helped both alleviate and completely offset seasonal moisture deficits associated with a poor/delayed start of the monsoon during November and December.?The report goes on to say that areas of south east Africa have seen rainfall amounts 150% higher than normal.
?During the last 30 days, analysis of rainfall anomaly tendency shows the greatest positive changes (>100mm) have occurred throughout southern Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and western Madagascar. It is these areas that are now experiencing approximately 150 percent of their normal precipitation for the season.?NOAA predicts further heavy rainfall over the coming days, and possibly for the rest of January. This makes the possibility of more flooding highly likely, in particular as river levels are already high.?These torrential rains not only reportedly triggered flooding in central Zimbabwe during the last week, but are also expected to elevate the risk for downstream inundation along the Zambezi, Save, Buzi, Pungwe, and Limpopo Rivers in Mozambique.?Cahora Bassa Dam Such heavy rainfall in this area invariably focuses attention on the Cahora Bassa dam. Mozambique?s Disaster Management Technical Council (CTGC) say that the reservoir still has plenty of storage capacity, and so Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), the company that operates the dam, is currently only discharging 2,500 cubic metres a second.
But if the current scenario persists, HCB may be obliged to increase the discharges in order to guarantee the safety and integrity of the dam itself. Increased discharges from Cahora Bassa will inevitably increase the threat of flooding on the lower Zambezi.A dambreach would prove disastrous for communities downstream of the dam. The flood wave would reach Tete (with a population of more than 150,000) just 10 hours after the breach.See the report by Marc Hartman of HKV Consultants for an animation of the potential flood resulting from a dambreach in the Cahora Bassa dam.Mozambique   Yesterday 134 mm of rain fell was recorded in 24 hours in Nampula, Mozambique. Severe weather has been affecting Nampula Province for the last 2 weeks and 9 people have been reported as killed in Nacala city. The deaths were thought to have been caused by lightning strikes and by the collapse of a wall during a thunderstorm.According to a statement made by Mozambique government?s Disaster Management Technical Council (CTGC), around 2,500 houses have been damaged or destroyed in the floods and rainstorms since late December 2014. Almost 10,000 families have been affected, with Maputo province and city are thought to be some of the worst affected areas.
Zimbabwe    At least 10 people have died in the floods in Zimbabwe. The latest assessment from the Zimbabwe Red Cross says that over 160 houses have been destroyed. Other media reports says this total should be closer to 2,000. Assessment work is still being carried out by the Red cross and Zimbabwe authorities.   Malawi   Six people have been reported as killed in recent flooding in Malawi ? four in Mangochi, two in Zomba. Further deaths are likely, according to Paul Chiunguzeni, Commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs, who spoke to Anadolu News Agency.World Bulletin report that at least 500 families have been displaced by the floods, which have destroyed houses and crops.South East Africa ?

Over the next several hours, rescuers pulled 26 more people from cars in the Hemet and San Jacinto areas, county fire spokesman Lucas Spelman said. Several cars and SUVs remained stuck in mud, some with only their roofs exposed.Residents of eight nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution, and numerous roads in the inland region were closed, Spelman said.South in San Diego County, morning floodwaters sent a mudflow 80 feet wide into roads in the Alpine area.The diminishing Pacific system brought three days of rain to California. There was some flooding and evacuations near hillsides stripped bare by wildfires, but the Los Angeles area avoided major damage despite some huge rainfall totals. An exceptional 14.5 inches has fallen since Tuesday at Yucaipa Ridge in the San Bernardino Mountains, the National Weather Service said.Most other parts of the state received 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The storm dropped snow in mountains key to the state's water supply and made signature waterfalls flow at Yosemite National Park, including the 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls that had slowed to a trickle in mid-July.But the needed soaking also caused problems: likely opening a pair of sinkholes in San Francisco, including a 20-by-30-foot chasm in a neighborhood, and flooding freeways in Sacramento.The San Francisco Bay Area reached or exceeded normal annual rainfall totals for the first time in years.Just before the storm arrived, the Sierra Nevada snowpack - which accounts for most of the state's water supply - was at just 24 percent of normal for this time of year. But snow was building rapidly with reports of 10 inches of snowfall at elevations of 8,000 feet.That good news was tempered by a stark reality: California needs many more such storms to alleviate a three-year drought."

The winter season has hit Morocco this year with full force as heavy rains and floods invaded numerous southern cities and towns, causing numerous deaths and leading to a severe damage in the country's infrastructure.At least 40 people have reportedly been killed in the floods so far, while more than 200 have been rescued. Others, meanwhile, remain missing as search and rescue teams have been dispatched to look for them in hard to reach areas.The unprecedented downpour also gravely harmed the country's agricultural sector, destroyed tens of buildings and led to the collapse of bridges, in addition to completely isolating several neighbourhoods.As soon as the crisis hit the northern African country, Moroccan Red Crescent teams were ready to provide relief and rescue services to affected families and individuals through the organisation's local committees and through maintaining close contact with the central headquarters.Six hundred volunteers were mobilised and 50 local intervention teams were formed to respond to the emerging needs, as the organisation's warehouses were opened for the distribution of relief items such as blankets, mattresses, and hygiene kits aimed to 1,100 families.The National Society has also been collaborating with health, civil and military bodies to coordinate in relief services and in the delivery of food and non-food items, and in the provision of first-aid, transport and psycho-social support.""Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Malika, the chairperson of the organisation, has requested the mobilisation of all available resources to respond to the needs of people who were most affected by the floods in several parts of the country,"" the Moroccan Red Crescent Society said in a released statement.The first relief operations took place in the provinces of Ouarazate and Tinghir where 700 families were targeted. The Moroccan Red Crescent has also put under its disposal its basic preparedness stock, which is part of its contingency plan, to provide 2,100 families with basic urgent needs.Meanwhile, the National Society's volunteers got involved in providing medical services and organising health awareness and prevention campaigns in cooperation with several medical bodies. First aid posts were also set up to provide basic health services.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has been closely following up on the situation in Morocco, and has mobilised its operations teams to provide the necessary support for the Moroccan Red Crescent.The Federation has also allocated a Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of 245,000 Swiss francs to procure and distribute food and non-food items to refill the basic stocks of the Moroccan National Society, and to provide essential services including first aid and psycho-social support.This year's unprecedented downpour surpassed 200 millimetres and led to the rise of water levels in rivers and in the flooding of valleys, an unfamiliar phenomenon which the country has not witnessed since the 1980s."

BEIJING?Flooding in southwestern China over the past week has left 44 people dead and 18 missing, and caused damage to housing and crops, the Civil Affairs Ministry said Saturday.

Constant heavy rain since Aug. 31 has caused widespread destruction in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, as well as the megacity of Chongqing, where all but one of the deaths occurred and all of the missing were reported.

The ministry said 121,700 people had been moved to temporary shelters and put the number of collapsed or heavily damaged houses at 42,000. It estimated total damage at more than 3.3 billion yuan ($538 million).

Southwestern China's mountainous terrain increases the chances of landslides brought on by the loosening of rain-saturated hillsides.

Seasonal rains cause major flooding around China most years. The worst in recent history was in 1998, when more than 4,000 people died, most of them along the Yangtze River.

The massive Three Gorges Dam has largely contained Yangtze flooding, but the problem persists in other parts of the country apart from the arid northwest."

This prompted residents to prepare to evacuate, as it brought back memories of a flood in 2006 when the area was also hit by a landslide.In Angthong's Pa Moke district, flood-prone tambon Phong Pheng has again been inundated, affecting 3,000 villagers. A flood aid centre was opened yesterday, with some 200 police, Army and provincial administrators, 20 flat-bottom boats, and four Humvees deployed to assist people hit by the flood.Up North, residents and business owners in Chiang Rai's Mae Sai district moved belongings to higher ground after parts of the Thai-Myanmar border, especially the Tambon Mae Sai municipality, was hit by a 30cm flood. A flash flood also caused inundation in many parts of Muang district.In Bangkok, BMA Department of Drainage and Sewerage director Adisak Khantee reported to Sukhumbhand that the city would have heavy rain in several areas over the weekend, while seasonal seawater inflows were expected at the end of the month. Adisak said the city had prepared to handle the situation with 166 water pump stations, 217 sluice gates, and seven drainage tunnels. He said city workers had cleared almost 100 per cent of waterways and sewage pipes. A total of 520 water pumps were installed at flood-prone spots, while staff at relevant facilities were on alert.Sukhumbhand said the situation was not worrisome because the Bhumibol, Sirikit and Pa Sak Jolasid dams were still at 30-40 per cent capacity. However, he urged Adisak's office to monitor the rainfall in order to handle any flooding in a timely manner. He said the city, being more equipped than the Highway Department and the Rural Roads Department, had received the National Council for Peace and Order's permission to handle Bangkok's flood-hit roads. Sukhumbhand later inspected the Bang Sue tunnel, which is under construction and slated for completion in September 2016. He said the Bt2.4 billion, 5.4m-wide tunnel, which can drain water into the Chao Phraya River at 60 cubic metres per second, would help prevent flooding in Chatuchak, Bang Sue, Huai Khwang, Ratchathewi, Phaya Thai and Lat Phrao.The Royal Irrigation Department urged residents in low-lying areas near the Chao Phraya who are outside flood barriers, to brace for flooding due to rising water levels.

The Emergency Operations Committee (COE) in Dominican Republic have said that almost 4,000 people have been displaced by recent flooding in the country after several days of heavy rainfall. One person has been reported as missing after he was swept away by flood water in Hato Mayor province.

The floods have damaged over 600 houses and left several communities cut off. Bridges, roads and power lines have also been damaged. The worst affected areas have been the eastern parts of the country, in particular the provinces of San Pedro de Macoris, El Seibo and Hato Mayo.

No relief centres or temporary accommodation have been set up for the displaced, who are all currently being housed by relatives or neighbours.

High rainfall levels have led to the overflowing of several rivers, including the Ozama and Soco. According to WMO, in a 24 hour period between 23 and 24 August 2014, 128 mm of rain fell in La Romana, Dominican Republic.

The heavy rain is a result of Tropical Cyclone Cristobal in the Caribbean which has affected other countries since 23 August, and is headed for the Bahamas, although has since weakened and been downgraded to a tropical storm.

SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A bus carrying more than 50 wedding guests was swept away Thursday by a flooded stream in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir and all but three of the passengers were missing, officials said.

Police officer Rajesh Kumar said the three swam to safety and told rescuers that about 50 others were trapped in the bus.

Rescuers were searching for the bus but had not been able to locate it in the gushing waters. New landslides and heavy rains blocked access to the area, Kumar said.

Officials earlier said the bus was carrying about 70 people. ""There is a lot of confusion,"" Kumar said.

The Press Trust of India news agency said the bride and bridegroom were among the missing people who were returning home from a wedding ceremony in a village in the Rajouri region, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir.

The region's wedding season has been disrupted by heavy rains and the worst floods in 22 years, and many ceremonies have been postponed.

At least 18 people have died in the past two days, and authorities on Thursday closed schools and stopped train services in the Kashmir valley. Meteorologists said the heavy rains were likely to continue for another two days.

Police officer Imtiyaz Hussain said the 18 victims were swept away by floodwaters or buried by mud from mountain slopes - 14 in the Jammu region and four in the Kashmir valley. They included a paramilitary officer whose bunker collapsed on him.

Soldiers and rescue workers used boats to move thousands of people to higher ground. At least 100 villages across the Kashmir valley were flooded by overflowing lakes and rivers, including the Jhelum river, which was up to 1.5 meters (4 feet) above its danger level, officials said.

Landslides and floods are common in India during the monsoon season, which runs from June through September.

Parts of Srinagar were also flooded. In Bemina, a large neighborhood, thousands of residents waded through ankle-high water that entered their homes.

Authorities evacuated 5,000 people from the neighborhood and 100 others were believed to be stranded there.

Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both. They have fought three wars, two of them over control of Kashmir, since winning independence from Britain in 1947.  ....Flood alert sounded in Srinagar as Jhelum swells

While the country?s disaster response capacity has been enhanced in recent years, experts argue that with people displaced and crops destroyed the flooding is testing response mechanisms.

""Improvement has been made in regard to flood forecasting system but there is still lack of coordination among government agencies,"" Mahbuba Nasreen, director of the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies at Dhaka University, told IRIN. 

A 31 August situation report by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief said 17 of the country?s 64 districts have been affected. Six of these districts are expected to experience rising water levels this week, and Dhaka, the capital and home to 15 million people, may see flooding as well.

NGOs estimate that the floods have left 500,000 homeless and, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), ?others, who have nowhere else to go, have remained in their flooded homes.?

Nasreen explained that part of the remaining weakness is due to Bangladesh?s Water Development Board being responsible for building and repairing embankments, which protect against floods, while the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief is responsible for reacting to disasters. This, she argued, results in lack of coordination between the two agencies.

""One organization should look after the whole thing,"" she said. ""There are still lots of things to do to improve [the] country's disaster response.""

Immediate relief

According to government figures, 17 people have died due to drowning in the floods, and there have been 506 cases of pneumonia, 1,850 cases of diarrhoea and 540 cases of skin infections.

Residents in the affected districts told IRIN they were worried both about the short- and long-term consequences of the flooding as they struggled to find dry ground and watched their crops get washed away.

Abdul Mannan, a father of four and farmer in Pikan Village in Rangpur District, said: ?Most of my lands are being inundated. I don?t know how can I manage basic things for my family in the coming days.?

Christa R„der, WFP representative in Bangladesh, told IRIN the agencies? assistance has focused on the distribution of nutritious biscuits, which do not require cooking. ?Since 24 August WFP has reached more than 50,000 people with nutritious biscuits in the flood- and river erosion-affected districts of the north,? she said, explaining that many people have fled their flood-hit homes and are now living on higher ground or embankments, without stoves or cooking utensils.

?This immediate food assistance is important as in the initial period after a flood people have no means to cook and depend on our ready-to-eat assistance,? she said, adding: ?There are many more displaced people in the flood-affected areas who have not yet received immediate assistance.?

Fewer deaths

Some indicators suggest Bangladesh?s disaster response capacity has improved in recent years. While 17 people have died in this year?s floods, a similar round of flooding in 2007 killed 1,110 people, a flood in 1998 killed 1,050, and a flood in 1988 killed 2,379.

The government has modernized its Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, which now gives up-to-date flood forecasting five days in advance (as opposed to an earlier threshold of three days), as well as information online and to people who call in.

Long-term concerns

Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, executive direct of the NGO Coast Trust, told IRIN the government?s response must also consider long-term relief measures.

?We urge government to provide shelters to the homeless families, to provide food supply until next March as they have lost the aman [main rice] crops, and double the various safety net programmes for the affected and marginalized, especially for the fishermen families, women- and child-headed households,? he said, referring to the government?s various ?safety net? allowances for older people, widows, and people with disabilities, among others.

Floods in eastern Bangladesh in 2012 left thousands food insecure as water remained for prolonged periods and damaged crops severely.

According to Oxfam?s Bangladesh country director Snehal Soneji, this year?s flooding is also damaging agricultural land.

?The main crops aman and aush [the two main rice crops], jute and vegetables are completely damaged as most of the fields are under water for the last 17 days. Damage of main agriculture adversely affects livelihoods of the farmers in long run,? he said.

Other evidence points to infrastructure damage that will have short- and long-term impacts.

?A large number of hand tube-wells are estimated to have been contaminated by flood waters, forcing the affected population to seek alternative water sources,? the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and International Federation of the Red Cross warned in a statement. ?With the shortage of safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities, the risk of diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases remain high.?

?Safe drinking water, hygiene kit, sanitation, cash-for-food are among the immediate needs at the time,? Soneji said, adding that Oxfam has provided hygiene kits to 600 households.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh?s disaster management and relief minister, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, insisted on a visit to affected areas that the government was responding effectively.

Over a thousand villages are flooded in nine districts of east UP. As many as 31 people have died and about half a million are affected by the floods aggravated by the unannounced release of waters from Nepal. The worst-hit district in UP is Bahraich, which is cheek by jowl with Nepal. Over 200 villages are virtually submerged under water and lakhs have been displaced in this remote eastern UP district which has recorded the maximum number of deaths (15) due to floods. Official sources say Army helicopters have been dropping food packets in the affected villages there.

What is worse is that electricity supply to this vast swathe of eastern UP has been cut off so that no one gets electrocuted. If that was not bad enough, things are expected to get worse with the Met officials predicting heavy rainfall in UP's eastern parts in the coming days.

Shravasti, Balrampur, Sitapur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Gonda, Barabanki, Faizabad and Azamgarh are the other districts in the state that have been badly affected by the floods.

""We are doing our best to reach relief to the affected people,"" UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan told dna. He said at least six lakh hectares of land had been affected and over 600 houses had been washed away. So far, 17,000 villagers have been rescued and efforts are on to reach remote areas surrounded by flood waters, he added. The state government has released Rs51 crore as relief for the flash flood-hit districts, Ranjan informed.

The Centre has issued an ""unprecedented flood situation"" warning for the Rapti, which is flowing above the danger mark in eastern UP. It threads through densely populated parts of the state.

Chief revenue officer, Bahraich, Uday Shankar described the floods as unprecedented. ""This is after 20 years that such floods are being seen in this district. The sudden release of water from Nepal gave no time to the villagers to prepare for evacuation. Many link roads and the main road connecting Bahraich to Shravasti are cut off. Most of the area is flooded due to the bloated Saryu,"" he said.

TV visuals show cattle, children and elders standing on embankments, swimming through flooded villages, marooned atop their submerged houses or being ferried by boats along with their bedding and gunny bags of wheat and grass.

A senior irrigation department official said despite relief work on a war-footing 60 villages of Bahraich were still inaccessible. Helicopters have been dropping food packets there, he said.

In Barabanki, the Ghaghra is dangerously on the rise. District magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra said though the situation here was not as bad as in Bahraich, as many as 70 more villages here were affected on Sunday and 25 of them have completely been evacuated, with people living in tents at embankments with their families and cattle. ""We are trying to evacuate villages and no deaths have occurred here till now,"" he said.

UP chief secretary blames Nepal
UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan has squarely blamed Nepal for the flash floods in eastern UP districts. ""Rivers like Rapti and Ghaghra were over flowing because of excess release of water from Nepal. While the Rapti was over flowing because authorities in Bhalubang, Bhairahwa and Kusum barrages in Nepal released excess water, the Ghagra has swollen due to release of flood waters from Chisapani barrage in Nepal. The other terai rivers in spate are Saryu and Sharda,"" he told dna on Monday.
Ranjan said engineers of the irrigation department were monitoring the situation round the clock lest more fresh areas were inundated. The Nepal authorities never informed their UP counterparts in advance, he said, adding, ""this could have given us some time to evacuate the villagers in time.""
He said para-military forces had been pushed into service and Army had been asked to stand by. The UP government has called in Army choppers for rescue work while a team of NDRF has been rushed from Varanasi to Bahraich. Around 5,000 people were rescued by the PAC and NDRF teams, Ranjan said.
""Medical teams have been rushed to Bahraich while PAC has deployed 19 motorboats and 378 boats to rescue the people,"" he said21 Killed in Floods in Uttar Pradesh, India, Posted by Richard Davies on August 17, 2014, At least 21 people have died and 300,000 affected after 2 major rivers in Uttar Pradesh burst their banks.
River levels have increased after several days of heavy rain in the state and in the rivers? catchment areas in Nepal. At least 65 people have died in floods in Nepal over the last few days. After days of torrential rain in Nepal, it was inevitable that authorities there would need to open barrages to release excess water and ease pressure on dams. This has since increased river levels in Uttar Pradesh.

According to the Times of India the barrages at Bhalubang, Bhairahwa and Kusum, as well as Chisapani, were opened some time between 15 and 16 August 2014.

River levels in Uttar Pradesh were already swollen by the heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the Himalayas. Since opening the barrages, the Rapti and Ghaghara rivers in Uttar Pradesh have both flooded, affecting around 300,000 people across 6 districts. Levels of the Sarayu and Sharda rivers are also dangerously high.

So far the districts affected are Bahraich, Shrawasti, and Lakhimpur Kheri, which have all been flooded by the Rapti river, and Barabanki, Siddharth Nagar and Faizabad, which have been inundated by the overflowing Ghaghara river.

There are some disturbing reports that as many as 300 people are missing across the two districts of Bahraich and Lakhimpur Kheri. District authorities fear the worst.

Alok Ranjan, chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh, confirmed on sunday 17 August, that at least 21 people have died in the floods."

Authorities in Nepal and neighboring India sent food, medical supplies and tents Monday to areas where monsoon floods have displaced thousands of people and killed at least 180 in recent days.

Four helicopters with relief supplies and medical workers were sent to cut-off villages in western Nepal, Jhanka Nath Dhakal of the National Emergency Operation Center said. Most roads into the area are submerged or damaged by flooding, preventing vehicles from passing.

Thousands of people are without shelter in 10 flooded districts, and local officials on Monday distributed rice and lentils and cooking pots to people who lost their homes. The area is mainly farmland where the poor live in mud and straw huts that wash away easily.

At least 100 people have died in Nepal since Thursday, and at least 84 have died in neighboring India due to torrential rains or overflowing rivers after dams were opened in Nepal, authorities said.

In northern India, at least 50 people have died in Uttarakhand state, many of them washed away as rivers overflowed, submerging villages and fields. Officials in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state reported 10 more deaths overnight, pushing its toll to 34.

People in the worst-affected villages were being evacuated to relief camps set up in government and school buildings, said Alok Ranjan, a government official in Uttar Pradesh.

State authorities said paramilitary soldiers in some 400 boats were helping to evacuate people from their homes after entire villages were marooned in northern Uttar Pradesh.

Several rivers overflowed after water was released from dams in Nepal, Ranjan said.

Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala appealed to both and domestic and foreign agencies to help flood victims there. The main opposition party in Parliament, the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, disrupted parliamentary proceedings and demanded that the government declare a national emergency.

Dhakal said the government was trying to send medical teams and supplies to prevent diseases such as cholera that can follow flooding. They are also distributing tents and plastic sheets to make temporary shelters, utensils to cook food and clothes for those who lost their belongings.

The June-September monsoon season often bring flooding to Nepal and neighboring India. The rains caused a landslide earlier this month that covered an entire village near Katmandu, killing 156 people.

The Nepal authorities are also working with local Red Cross volunteers to distribute medicine, clothing and blankets.

Many roads have been blocked by landslides and flood debris, making it difficult to reach many of the flooded villages. Work is under way to repair or clear roads and bridges.

The relief operation includes use of helicopters to deliver food, emergency supplies, medicine and medical workers to the affected areas. The helicopters have also been used to evacuate 100s of people from the worst affected areas.

It is thought the driver was attempting to cross a bridge over the swollen Uttali river. There is also thought to have been a fourth passenger, although authorites are yet to recover a body.

The recovery of the 3 bodies brings the death toll of the recnet floods in Odisha to 6.

Original Report from 23 July 2014

Monsoon rain has brought deadly floods the central and eastern parts of India over the last few days, killing at least 5 people with 2 still missing.

Two deaths occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh, where around 300 villages have been flooded. Three people died in flooding in the neighbouring state of Odisha after rivers overflowed.

Chhattisgarh

Two days of heavy rain in the state of Chhattisgarh has left over 300 villages under water. Over 350mm of rain fell in just 48 hours, bringing the July total to 422.5mm. Further rainfall has been forecast for the state.

The worst affected districts are Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker and Bastar. Two people have died as a result of the flooding, one in Mahasamund and another in Kanker where the Kotri river overflowed. Other rivers, including Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati and Doodh have also burst their banks.

Odisha

Local media reports claim around 200 villages have suffered from flooding in the state of Odisha over the last few days, affecting over 50,000 people. Four days of heavy monsoon rain between 18 and 22 July 2014 increased rivers to danger levels and many have burst their banks. Jharsuguda saw 103mm of rain in 24 hours on 21 July. The worst affected areas are the districts of Jajpur, Keonjhar, Kalahandi and Bhadrak.

Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) and National Disaster Response Force have evacuated 15,000 people from the districts of Jaipur, Keonjhar and Bhadrak. Three people died in the floods, and another 2 are still missing in Kaptipada in Mayurbhanj district.

The most recent indications are that flood water in some areas has started to recede. Earlier today Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) said that levels of major rivers including Mahanadi, Kushabhadra, Baitarani, Budhabalang, Subarnarekha and Vansdhara were now below danger level. Levels of the Devi, Brahmani, Subarnarekha, Vansadhara and Rusikulya rivers are still above flood stage however.


The unfortunate location of Odisha leaves it vulnerable to floods from both tidal and river floods. The states coastla regions are regularly hit by cyclones and storm surges. The state?s rivers frequently overflow after heavy monsoon rainfall either in the state itself or further upriver.

Odisha suffered flooding from the fall out of cyclone Phailin in October last year when heavy rain caused the Baitarani, Budha Balanga and Subernarekha rivers to overflow. Earlier in the year, heavy monsoon rainfall had resulted in floods which affected around 250,000 people, mostly in the northern parts Odisha. Three people were reported as killed in flood related events."""

PRESS RELEASE

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia ? The UN refugee agency and its partners have begun distributing urgently needed food to thousands of South Sudanese in flooded camps in western Ethiopia's Gambella region.

But humanitarian aid workers face major challenges providing assistance. The floods are also affecting the border crossings at Matar and Pagak and the Kule and Tierkidi camps, with many refugees making their way to drier ground.

In Leitchuor and Nip Nip, which together hold some 50,000 people, the continuing heavy rains have destroyed traditional shelters (tukuls) and temporary structures and forced refugees to move to higher ground, near the host community. UNHCR and the government have started to look at possible new sites where they can relocate the most vulnerable.

A rapid needs assessment, conducted last week by an inter-agency team, including UNHCR, found that both refugees and locals need food and water above all else. The situation is most serious at Nip Nip, because the floodwaters have made the road impassable and water tankers cannot reach the camp.

Based on the results of the needs assessment, the World Food Programme, with help from the government's refugee agency and UNHCR, has distributed general food rations, including sorghum, lentils and cooking oil. UNHCR is also distributing tents, plastic sheets, sleeping mats and hygiene and sanitation items in unflooded areas of Leitchuor and Nip Nip.




UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations working at the two camps are looking at the most effective ways to distribute more relief supplies, including water purification tablets, and how to help people access mobile health and nutrition clinics.

The refugee agency is also helping to step up mass information campaigns for the refugees, to give them daily updates on services available, the flood situation and advice on how to prevent outbreaks of disease.

The rains and floods pose serious public health threats because latrines and sanitation facilities have been destroyed. Malaria, Hepatitis E and cholera are the biggest threats. M‚decins Sans FrontiŠres completed a mass oral cholera vaccination campaign over the weekend in Gambella with help from UNHCR, the government and others.

More than 190,000 refugees have fled from South Sudan to Ethiopia, almost all of them to Gambella, since conflict flared last December, bringing the total number of South Sudanese refugees to more than 250,000........Sudan Floods Death Toll Rises to 77

Sudan Famine. Kampala ? Internally displaced people (IDPs) in South Sudan's Unity state held a demonstration on Saturday, calling on the UN mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) to improve facilities at a protection site after heavy flood waters washed out temporary shelters at the camp.

Many of the victims and relatives of those sheltering at the Rubkotna camp have been sharing disturbing pictures on Facebook showing the damage caused by flooding.

A UN staff member working in the area who spoke on condition of anonymity told Sudan Tribune that the camp had been inundated by flood waters over the past four days.

He confirmed the demonstration over problems facing displaced people at the camp.

He told Sudan Tribune the situation had become dire as heavy rain continues to fall in the area, describing the situation for displaced people at the Rubkotna camp as life threatening.

""Yesterday (Saturday) I witness a woman giving birth in such [a] terrible situation, but lucky enough she was rushed to hospital in the UN and all went fine with her delivery,"" he said.

He has called on UNMISS to immediately step in to help prevent further flooding in the low-lying area, warning that the situation continued to go from bad to worse for residents at the camp.

SLEEPLESS NIGHTS

Maliah Ter, one of the displaced people sheltering at the UNMISS camp, says she hadn't slept for four days after heavy rain dislodged her family from shelters.

""We were sleeping in water for those having beds and those without beds kept standing the whole day and night because they have nowhere to go,"" Ter said in an interview with Sudan Tribune on Sunday. The situation has sparked fears of an outbreak of waterborne diseases.

Some 40,000 people are currently sheltering at the Rubkotna camp, according to the UN, the majority of them lost their homes after heavy fighting erupted between rebel and government forces in both Bentiu and Rubkotna.

The warring parties have been engaged in an armed struggle since mid-December last year after political tensions within the ruling SPLM turned violent.

Unity state has been a flashpoint for violence, with the capital, Bentiu, changing hands several times at the height of the conflict.

Reports show that more civilians are amassing at the UNMISS camp every day, driven out of their hiding places in the bush by hunger.

Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe unless the warring sides halt fighting on the ground.

Description of the Event
Torrential rain in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has caused flooding which has led to two deaths and an estimated 20,000 people evacuated.
Rio Grande do Sul is Brazil's most southern state, and borders Uruguay and Argentina. A state of emergency was declared in the state on 4 July 2014, following over a week of rain which began on 26 June. So far 115 towns and cities have been affected by the flooding across the state, which includes the state capital, Porto Allegre.
It is believed that the weather has been caused by the El Ni¤o effect, which warms the Pacific Ocean and usually results in hot and wet summers for South America.
This latest flood follows on from another batch of torrential rain which affected southern Brazil, and particularly Rio Grande do Sul's nearby states of Santa Catarina and Paran , in early June. The prolonged rainfall is expected to harm the area's agricultural production, due to saturated ground conditions. The Institute of Meteorology has reported that this was the wettest winter Brazil has experienced since 1983....18,400 Displaced in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
Posted by Richard Davies on July 11, 2014
Levels of the Uruguay River are so high in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has declared a state of emergency for at least 131 municipalities. Declaring a state of emergency means that federal funds can be made available to local governments for aid and relief.

Torrential rain led to high river levels. The ensuing floods have displaced 18,400 people spread across the 157 towns and cities.

According to the Defesa Civil of Rio Grande do Sul, most of those who fled their homes were being sheltered by relatives and friends. Around 1,300 have been given shelter in public buildings such as sports arenas or schools.

The worst affected areas are Ira¡ and Barra do Guarita, mostly as a result of extremely high levels of the Uruguay River. Some local media reports claim levels have not been this high since 1983. River levels rose so rapidly few had time to prepare.///FL-2014-000083-BRA Flood Brazil Flooding had killed 10 people in southern Brazil's Parana state by 11 June 2014, and state officials declared an emergency in 130 cities.

At least 9 people have been killed in floods and landslides in Sindhupalchok, Lalitpur and Chitwan districts of Nepal over the last 2 days. Heavy rain has fallen across the central Nepal region since 13 July 2014. The latest spate of disasters comes after 7 people died between 7 and 8 July 2014 after floods in Dang, Rautahat and Udaypur, as reported by The Himalayan Times.

Floods have struck in various parts of Sindhupalchok district over the last 2 days causing landslides and damage to houses. Six of the victims were caught in their homes as landslides or torrential rainfall caused the buildings to collapse.

Two other victims were working in a quarry in Lele, Lalitpur when they were caught in a landslide. One other victim, a woman, was swept 300 metres downstream by flood water in Chitwan, where around 650 homes are said to have been flooded."

Posted by Richard Davies on July 14, 2014
As many as 30 villages in the Bhola District in the Division of Barisal, Bangladesh have been inundated after flood water from the overflowing Meghna River swept over broken dykes. The river levels had been swollen by recent rain fall, but also dramatically increased after a high tide on Sunday 13 July 2014.

According to local media reports, the floods have affected the upazilas (sub-districts) of Monpura and Charfashion. Houses, schools, mosques, farmland and fish enclosures have been flooded, with some areas are said to be under around 1 metre (over 3 feet of water). Transport has also been affected, particularly since many river ferry terminals and gangways are also under water.

Normally these areas are protected by a flood control dyke. The dyke in this area along the Meghna River is extremely be vulnerable to the river erosion. It is a constant battle for authorities such as the Water Development Board to repair and upgrade embankments. Large stretches of the Bhola District emabnkment collapsed last year and local residents are still awaiting its repair. Locals are blaming the current floods on the fact that no proper action has been taken to repair the dyke. It seems that poor planning meant that work to carry out repairs was only ordered as recently as last month ? way too late to complete any substantial work before the rainy season."

Update: 12:40 p.m.

The city and borough of Juneau has closed View Drive and all roads leading into Meander Way, from Rivercourt Drive to Killewich Avenue along Riverside Drive.

The city is asking that all non-essential persons stay out of the area, as roads may become impassible due to flooding from the Mendenhall Lake and River.

Power may be shut off to isolated areas affected by flood waters.

The city also has closed the Brotherhood Bridge Trail, including the pedestrian bridge.

?Anywhere between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. is our best guess for the peak,? says National Weather Service Meterologist Bob Tschantz.

He says people should stay away from the saturated banks of the Mendenhall River.

They get under cut by the water that?s running, and eventually the ground over the top just kind of sloughs off,? he says. ?River bank erosion is a very big concern and you don?t want to be caught standing on the edge of the riverbank when it collapses into the river.?

 

Original story:

Wednesday evening?s j”kulhlaup, or glacial outburst from Suicide Basin above Mendenhall Glacier, has prompted flood warnings for Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River.

As of 9:15 a.m. Friday, Mendenhall Lake was measured at 10.18 feet and Mendenhall River registered 12.1 feet, or over flood stage for both those water bodies.

The National Weather Service expects new records will be set before the Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River crest late Friday afternoon or early evening. Their forecast calls for the lake to peak at 11.99 feet, beating the previous record of 11.2 feet. The river is forecast to top out at 14.95 feet, breaking the old record of 13.8 feet.

Prior to Wednesday evening?s j”kulhlaup, the Mendenhall Lake was measured at a level of between 5 and 6 feet and Mendenhall River was measured as between 8 and 9 feet.

?So, the campground is beginning to flood,? said meteorologist Rick Fritsch said during KTOO?s Morning Edition program on Friday. ?If we don?t have water over the West Glacier Spur Road (at 5:30 a.m.) that goes past Skater?s Cabin, (then) it will soon be over that road as well.?"

Instead of football players, crossing the pitch is a small motorboat and passing through the goalmouth is the overflowing Rio Negro river.

The goalposts stand half submerged, now meaningless markers on an invisible field.

For more than a month, Careiro da Varzea in the Brazilian state of Amazonas has been under water in one of the worst floods on record.

It is one of almost 40 areas in Amazonas in an emergency situation or a state of calamity affecting more than 300,000 people.

Water pours through wooden bungalows in river communities, standing stagnant on the floors of their homes, bringing waterborne diseases and making access difficult without a boat.

Since the end of last year, heavy rains have pushed the Rio Negro, which flows into the Amazon, to emergency levels.

Map showing the Manaus region of Amazonas state in Brazil
Meanwhile, the biggest tributary of the Amazon, the Rio Madeira, reached record heights and caused the worst flooding for a century across more remote parts of north-west Brazil and northern Bolivia.

Experts say the water is expected to remain until the middle of July before eventually subsiding, leaving those who live on the river to rebuild their vulnerable homes.

""We consider a situation to be extreme when the river reaches the emergency level,"" explains Marco Antonio de Oliveira, who is the regional superintendent of the Brazilian Geological Service in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas.

""In this year's floods, the river reached emergency levels on 22 May. We have spent practically the whole of June above the emergency level.

""It's likely that this year, the time that the water has remained high and inside the homes of some of the poorest in Manaus will surpass 50 days.""

From the air, it is possible to see whole swathes of towns on the banks of the Rio Negro marooned by the river.

And by boat, the damage to the homes is clear to spot.

Many communities living on the edge of Manaus, where streams known as igarapes weave their way from the river through the city, have been affected.

'Many people are suffering'
Neto Carvalho, 63, who has lived at the edge of an igarape for 20 years, filmed the worst of the flooding on his mobile phone.

""It started six months ago and it will take another six months for it to go down,"" he predicts.

""The water is very close. There's a lot of debris and we don't have any sanitation. The children who study on the other side [of the igarape] have to do a big detour to get to school.

The Northland Rural Support trust has had an immediate response to its call for emergency feed and grazing to help flood-stricken farmers in the region.
The trust has been closely monitoring the impact of the past week's storm and prolonged rainfall, and put out the call for help on Sunday.
Co-ordinator Julie Jonker said little grazing had been offered but farmers from as far away as Manawatu had offered to send feed, which was in short supply in Northland following the drought.
""We've got a perfect storm in that we've had a drought. People often use some of their winter supplements to get them through the drought period and now, when we were hoping for a mild, not-too-wet winter, we ended up with a flood as bad as the 2007 one that we had,"" she said.
""We also had those strong winds, and there was a lot of damage to infrastructure such as cow shed roofs blowing off, calf and hay sheds damaged, so chances are some feed supplements may have been damaged as well.
""We are still trying to quantify exactly what the damage is, not only financially but to the farmers involved.""
Farmers in the flood-prone Hikurangi Swamp area, north of Whangarei, had been among the hardest hit, Ms Jonker said.
Up to 30 farms there were flooded, and at least nine more downstream at Tangiteroria.
Weeks to clear
One of the flooded Hikurangi Swamp farmers, Ben Smith, said up to 70 percent of his effective dairy farm was under water and it would take weeks for the water to clear.
""The worst of us will be three to four weeks, so we'll have dead pasture from then. Depending on how well spring treats us, we'll need eight weeks after that to get the first grazing off the pasture, so you're talking two or three months, basically,"" Mr Smith said.
Evan Sneath, a dairy farmer at Hukerenui at the top end of Hikurangi Swamp, said flood levels had dropped a little but he still had about 60ha of land under water, and he was waiting for local council approval to cut the flood banks to clear the water more quickly.
""What we're trying to do there is let the water off our land quicker so we can get back on and start getting stuff in - grass seed or whatever we're going put back into it, and also to try and keep water quality,"" Mr Sneath said.
""The longer the water sits on our farm, the water quality deteriorates rapidly and it gets to the point where, if it sits too long, there's no oxygen left in the water and, going back into the streams, it starts killing off fish life and everything.""
Mr Sneath said he would also have to replace dead pasture, and he was making arrangements to truck in supplies of hay, silage and other supplementary feed.
""I'm doing that off my own bat but I'm also going to get in touch with Rural Support to try and look for some grazing for my young stock.""
Farmers who can help with feed or grazing should contact the Northland Rural Support Trust on 0800-787-254.////Three rescued, one missing in floods

Flooding is an annual hazard as the Maiyu-Baiu front develops, but reports of a month?s worth of rain in just 24 hours from parts of Guangxi suggest that some areas have seen exceptionally heavy rain in recent days.
Agricultural output has been badly affected and total economic loses have been estimated at around $650 million.
The weather front migrates slowly northwards between June and mid-July, reaching the Yangtze river valley by the month?s end. 
Meanwhile, summer heat and humidity are encouraging severe storms further north in the country. In Hebei province Red Alerts were issued for the risk of hail and lightning and there have been reports of extensive crop damage caused by large hailstones.""

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- As the rain-swollen Mississippi River carried on its plodding retreat Friday, western Illinois farmer Joe Zumwalt wasn't complaining about the flooding that wound up swamping a hundred or two of his 3,500 river-bottom acres of corn and soybeans.

Zumwalt lost all of it just a few years ago in 2008, when two of the region's levees couldn't hold back the engorged river, ultimately submerging tens of thousands of acres of farmland.

""I think what's happened this year is proof that the levees work,"" said Zumwalt, 36. ""If you stand on the top of the levee and look at the amount of water being held back and the potential devastation that could have occurred, you have to feel pretty good.""

The economic toll of Midwest flooding - typical of this time of year - only now is trickling in.

While officials say it's too early to estimate the flood's financial cost, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency says at least 383,000 acres of crops have been destroyed and 2 million damaged in Iowa and Illinois alone due to excessive rain, flash flooding, and flooding on the Mississippi River and its tributaries.

Crop damage in Missouri has not yet been reported to the USDA, Farm Service Agency spokeswoman Isabel Benemelis said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency still is getting preliminary damage assessments from pounding upper Midwest storms that led to the flood, and from the flooding itself, spokeswoman Amanda Bicknell said.

""This is really a moving target,"" she said.

Buyouts of flood-prone property since the benchmark flood of 1993 - and newer, bigger levees - have limited damage this time around, even though this flood ranked among the 10 highest ever in several locations. Still, the flood has damaged roads and infrastructure, along with scattered homes and businesses.

The flood came at a bad time for farmers, with corn having been flourishing in the nation's midsection and soybean plants still maturing.

Around his fields near Illinois' Warsaw, Zumwalt had cause for jubilance: Crops on just 100 to 200 acres got ruined in the past week or two by Mississippi River water that weaseled its way under the levees. But the levees held, said the Hancock County Farm Bureau's president, and that's all that mattered.

""We're not talking about huge amounts of crop loss,"" he said. ""By and large, the crops in our area look very good.""

While retreating Friday in most places, the Mississippi still was 8 feet above flood stage in Grafton, Illinois, a town without a levee about 40 miles north of St. Louis. The river level there was expected to start dropping. Despite its lack of protection, damage there was minimal.

Both bridges closed by the flood have reopened. Traffic resumed Thursday afternoon at the Quincy (Illinois) Memorial Bridge. The Champ Clark Bridge at Louisiana, Missouri, was also open, but with one lane only, said Paris Ervin, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Transportation.

Impact of the Quincy bridge closing was minor because the town has two bridges. When the Louisiana bridge closed on Sunday, drivers on U.S. 54 had to go 35 miles north to Hannibal, Missouri, to cross the river.////June 25, 2014: ""CHICAGO ? Minnesota was besieged on Tuesday by some of its most widespread flooding in years. Water spilled onto streets in downtown St. Paul, crops of soybeans and corn were damaged and a state of emergency was declared in 35 counties.The flooding spanned vast regions of the state, from the Canadian border to Iowa. It was the result of an unusually heavy snowpack from winter, combined with torrential rain this spring and early summer that had filled lakes and wetlands. A major storm that brought close to six inches of rain last week in parts of the state pushed the already swollen Mississippi, Crow and St. Croix Rivers to their limits.?This is severe flooding, and in many different locations in the state, which I haven?t seen before,? Gov. Mark Dayton said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ?I?ve seen severe weather ? tornadoes, flash floods and ice storms ? but usually they impact one area of the state. This one is the whole state.?In St. Paul, the capital, the Mississippi River rose to a nearly 20-foot crest, forcing the closing of some roads. In Stillwater, drivers were diverted from a bridge that links Minnesota and Wisconsin. And in Delano, west of the Twin Cities, businesses close to the Crow River were quickly evacuated. Residents of Waterville in southern Minnesota resorted to sandbags to fight off the Cannon River.Officials expected the Mississippi River to crest in St. Paul on Thursday at 20.5 feet, the sixth-highest on record.?It?s been quite a historical flood for this area,? said Craig Schmidt, a service hydrologist for the National Weather Service. ?We?ve got large, large areas of the state that are underwater. We?ve had some of our gauges hit record highs.?Weather experts said the flooding arrived unusually late in the year, leaving officials scrambling to control the high water with sandbags, flood walls and makeshift barriers.Mr. Dayton called it ?a building emergency? and planned to continue traveling the state this week to visit communities and assess the damage. President Obama is expected to stop in Minnesota on Thursday for an unrelated event, and Mr. Dayton said that he intended to discuss the crisis with him.Elsewhere in the Midwest, flooding affected homes and businesses in South Dakota, Missouri and northwest Iowa. Roughly 150 homes in Iowa suffered major flood damage, officials said. The federal Department of Transportation has pledged $750,000 for the repair of flood-damaged Iowa roads.The mayor of St. Paul, Chris Coleman, declared a state of emergency there. In Newport, Minn., a small city along the Mississippi, a sand station was set up so that residents could make sandbags for their homes.Some city officials worried that infrastructure meant to protect cities from storms was hopelessly outdated.Deb Hill, the city administrator in Newport, said that a levee built more than 50 years ago to protect the town was in ?terrible condition,? and only two feet from being breached.Even if it is not breached, if the water level in the river stays high, the levee could collapse from the continued pressure, she said.?Someday it will collapse,? she said. ?We?re preparing for that. Will it go tomorrow or will it go 10 years from now? Everyone?s aware that it will go. It?s just all anxiety and anticipation.?
Vickie Mirenda, an owner of the Peppermint Twist Drive-In in Delano, Minn., said that her business was safely across the road from the Crow River, but that nearby businesses had shut down temporarily.Her restaurant was unusually busy on Tuesday, and customers could talk of nothing but the flooding, she said, and the storms that threatened the region.?Every time we see a black cloud, we get nervous,? Ms. Mirenda said. ?I don?t know where else the water can go. We?re praying to keep the rain away.? ""Minnesota Floods Continue. Posted by Richard Davies on June 25, 2014. Levels of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers are expected to crest in the Twin Cities area over the next 2 days. The flood threat remains, in particular after further heavy rain in the north of the state yesterday. Local media say there are currently 8 state roadways or river crossings closed due to flooding across Minnesota. Governor Dayton and Minnesota?s Executive Council voted unanimously to extend the state of emergency in 35 counties of the state yesterday.
Rain in the North. Parts of northern Minnesota, including Marshall County, saw over 4 inches fall in 24 hours between 23 and 24 June 2014. The Middle River is reported to have burst its banks, affecting parts of the city of Middle River. Hastings. Meanwhile, south of the Twin Cities, the City of Hastings saw some flooding after the Mississippi broke its banks. Some roads are closed in the city, but as yet there are no reports of any damage to property.Yesterday river levels at Hastings stood at 17.85 feet, which is almost 3 feet above minor flood stage, and just under the major flood stage mark of 18 feet. However forecasters say the levels are still rising and the river is set to crest on Friday at around 19 feet.Costs. The city of St Paul claims it has spent $1.7 million on flood protection efforts since the floods first threatened around 10 days ago. In Delano, the authorities there say the flooding from the Crow River has caused around $250,000 damage already. Minnesota state has a new disaster fund of around $3 million and it is likely that federal help will be required.Iowa Floods Start to Recede. Elsewhere in the Midwest, the flood threat appears to be easing in Iowa. After something like three times the normal average rainfall last week (3.7 inches), flood water appears to be receding across much of Iowa. Although there are still many rivers with levels at flood stage, water levels are now dropping and most of the flooding is confined to roads, farmland and parks rather than homes or property."" June 20, 2014: ""NORTH SIOUX CITY, S.D. (AP) -- A swollen river that threatened homes where Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota meet crested earlier and at a lower level than expected early Friday. Minnesota officials toured waterlogged areas of that state, saying the severity and breadth of flooding make a federal disaster request a near certainty.The less-serious crest of the Big Sioux River prompted crews take down sandbags and other containers blocking a section of Interstate 29 that acted as a temporary levee to protect an at-risk South Dakota city.The road, which Lt. Gov. Matt Michels said remained dry while closed, reopened Friday afternoon. But some buildings, farmland and roads remain flooded, Michels said.""Do not drive on a road with water. It may not be there,"" he said.The National Weather Service had predicted earlier that the river would hit a record high around midday, but then said it crested at Sioux City, Iowa, around midnight a couple of feet below the previous record.
Days of thunderstorms upstream swelled the 420-mile-long river and threatened homes and businesses in the three surrounding states, including up to 400 in a neighborhood of North Sioux City, South Dakota.Craig Dam, 48, who owns Dam Auto Sales in Sioux City, Iowa, was relieved the water had started to drop. Dam spent part of Friday removing a 3-foot-high row of sandbags from the front and side of his house that friends, family, neighbors and students from a nearby high school put up on Thursday.""People just came out to help,"" he said.Had the river overtaken the interstate, the plan was for the water to flow down his street and empty into an empty lot.The change in the crest was due to a large amount of water released Tuesday night when a levee failed upstream at Akron, Iowa, said Mike Gillispie, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls.""Enough water went through the levee failure out into agricultural land there that it lowered the amount of water coming through at peak crest at Sioux City,"" he said.The river had been expected to crest at Sioux City about a foot above the 108.3-foot record set in 1969. Instead, it peaked at 105.6 feet and began dropping.As a result, the river in the Sioux City area will stay at a higher level longer than previously predicted, Gillispie said. He expects it to stay above the 99-foot flood stage, the level at which farmland around Sioux City is underwater, into Sunday or Monday.He said as long as the area doesn't get heavy rain over the next few days, the water should fall back below flood levels. While there is potential for scattered thunderstorms, he doesn't anticipate widespread rain.In Minnesota, heavy rains over several days left farm fields under water and roads washed out. Dams have failed and water has infiltrated homes. Four state parks have been fully or partially closed because of high water.""The damage is really unprecedented and very widespread,"" Gov. Mark Dayton said.In Minneapolis, a large section of mud gave way on a cliff near the Mississippi River. The slide occurred not far from a hospital near the University of Minnesota's campus. Minneapolis Assistant Fire Chief Charles Brynteson said the hospital building is set on bedrock and is sound. Two motorists accelerated to safety as the mud and debris were falling.""They very easily could have been trapped,"" he said. ""It was close.""Downstream, the Omaha Public Power District said it will reduce power as it prepares for rising water on the Missouri River. The district's Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant sits about 20 miles north of Omaha, and was surrounded by water during flooding three years ago."

Posted by Richard Davies on July 10, 2014
According to Juli n B ez, director of Meteorolog¡a e Hidrolog¡a in Paraguay, the levels of the Paraguay River in Asuncion have now started to fall. They peaked on Tuesday 8 July 2014 at 7.35 metres, then fell by 1 cm the next day. The measurement may be small, but levels are at least falling. In the lower basin area river levels are not expected to peak for another 2 days. In Pilar, the level stands at 8.43 metres and is expected to rise further.

El Ni¤o Could Bring Similar Floods by November

Snr. B ez also said that he expected river levels to continue declining until October or November, when the rainy season starts. Forecasters believe Paraguay will see heavy rainfall in the last 3 months of this year as a result of El Ni¤o. In other words, we could be seeing a repeat of the mass evacuations across the country in less than 6 months.

250,000 Affected across 10 Departments

Despite falling river levels, Paraguay?s National Emergency Secretariat (La Secretar¡a de Emergencia Nacional ? SEN) reported yesterday that the number of people affected by the flooding of the Paraguay and Parana rivers amounted to almost 250,000. Those affected are in Asuncion, and the departments of Alto Paraguay, Concepci¢n, Presidente Hayes, Boquer¢n, San Pedro, Alto Paran , Central, ¥eembuc£ and Misiones.////Jul 3, 4:32 PM EDT

ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguayan officials warned on Thursday of a possible environmental disaster because a flooding river is threatening a dump site for toxic residues.

State environmental chief Marina Cristina Morales said the Paraguay river already has flooded the Cateura dump in the capital city of Asuncion. The river has risen nearly 6.5 feet (2 meters) above normal, though it was still 9 feet (2.8 meters) below the level of a containment site for toxic waste.

""If the river continues to rise we will likely be facing an environmental disaster,"" Morales said.

The lower house of Congress approved declaration of an environmental emergency alert on Thursday and the Senate was expected to also approve the use of more resources, including $1 million aimed at preventing the contamination.

The flooding, after days of torrential rains, already has forced the evacuation of about 300,000 people near the Paraguay and Parana rivers. Most of them were still evacuated Thursday, sheltered in camps of improvised tents.

Paraguay's weather service forecasts that the swollen rivers will begin to slowly recede back to their normal levels by August.////June 25, 2014: ""Officials in Paraguay say floods caused by heavy rains have forced some 200,000 people across the country to leave their homes.
The country?s emergency service said Monday that an estimated 70,000 of the people who have escaped the rising waters are from the capital, Asuncion.Paraguay has seen heavy rainfall in recent weeks, which has caused the Paraguay and Parana rivers to overflow their banks.
The flooding has affected the departments of Neembucu, Alto Parana, Presidente Hayes and Alto Paraguay, as well as the municipalities of Ayolas and Asuncion. Rescue workers have set up some 60 government camps to shelter displaced families and have distributed clothes and foods among those affected by the floods.Meanwhile, the recent heavy rains have also affected Paraguay?s neighboring countries Argentina and Brazil.In Argentina, some 5,000 people have been forced out of their homes due to the flooding in the city of Formosa located at the border to Paraguay.This is while authorities in Brazil?s southern state of Santa Catarina said that the recent severe weather has caused an estimated 519 million reals (USD 233 million) in damage.In addition, the southern Brazilian state of Parana has been affected by torrential rains this month, which have caused the Iguazu River to break its banks. The flooding killed at least 13 people in the state and left thousands homeless.""

Heavy rainfall has now led to flooding in Paraguay, Brazil and parts of north east Argentina. River levels, especially those of the Paraguay and Paran  rivers are dangerously high. Some stretches of the Paran  and Paraguay rivers have already burst their banks.
Brazil
11 people have now died in the flooding in the state of Paran , where a total of 560,000 are reported to have been affected by flooding over the last week. The state of Santa Catarina is also affected. Further heavy rainfall is expected over the next few days.
Paraguay
2 people have been reported as killed in the flooding. A boy aged 10 drowned in flood waters near the Paran  River in Misiones Department yesdterday Thursday 12 June 2014, according to local police. As many as 160,000 have been affected in the country, with many of them in the capital Asunci¢n. Further rain is expected, along with some strong winds and cold temperatures.
Argentina
The north eastern area of Argentina that borders Paraguay and Brazil is also experiencing flooding. The province of Misiones is worst affected, in particular Montecarlo, Puerto Pira¡ and Caraguata¡. Roads and bridges have been damaged and thousands are believed to have been cut off from the outside world as a result. Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for the next 24 hours.
Iguazu Falls
As happened during flooding around the same time last year, authorities have closed the famous Iguazu Falls to tourists while water levels are so high. The safety of walkways around the falls has been compromised and the situation is considered to be too dangerous to allow tourists to the site.
2 Months of FloodingFlooding is farily frequent in this region of South America where the 3 countries meet. In fact the situation is very similar to the 2013 flooding of the Paran  River that  affected Paraguay, Argentina and parts of Brazil. One feature of last year?s floods to bear in mind was just how long they went on for. In 2013 the flooding lasted for almost 2 months, starting in early June and continuing through to the end of July.
1982 to 1983 Floods
One of the worst floods of the Paran  river was during 1982 to 1983. The flooding affected Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. 600,000 people were displaced, and there were 170 casualties killed in the floods.
Chile
Although not directly related to the flooding of the Paraguay and Paran  rivers, Chile is also experiencing floods in central and southern regions. Around 1,600 people have been displaced, and roads have been damaged leaving some communities isolated.
Floods in the first few days of June this year left around 4,000 people stranded in central and southern Chile.The intense rains in Paraguay, which started in March 2014, have been unusually intense for the season, leading to severe floods in rural communities and urban areas. The effects have continued to be felt with the flooding from the rapidly rising Paran  river and Paraguay river. To date, 39,000 families (195,000 people) from five departments in the country have been affected by the flooding and require humanitarian support. The most recent rains registered in the upper basin of the Iguaz£ river have led to the overflowing of this riverbed and the subsequent increase of water levels in the Paran  river. This has led to the increase in the amount of water in the reservoir of the Itaip£ and Yacyreta dams, which has required both dams to increase their water flow which in some cases has reached between 22,000 m?/s and 43,000 m?/s. As a consequence, the impact has been extreme for the riverside populations located in Alto Paran , Misiones and ¥eembuc£.

""Asunci¢n (Agenzia Fides) - At least 40 000 people have suffered serious damage due to the flooding which recently struck the western region of El Chaco, in Paraguay. According to data on behalf of the Secretariat for National Emergency (SNE), the heavy rains in the last 3 weeks which have fallen on this area of the South American country have caused the overflowing of the Pilcomayo River in the neighboring regions of Argentina, causing drownings in the center of El Chaco and isolating thousands of local families with their livestock. Currently 10 000 families are surrounded by water or are their homes are completely flooded and, given the negative forecasts for the next few days, it is feared that they could be become 40 000.

""I?m 82 years old. I?ve never seen such floods in my life."" Guangli resident Xiao Zihe said.The floodwaters inundated the terraced field, forming a 500-meter yellowish waterfall.""The flood overwhelmed over four hectares of farmland, including rice patties and other fields. The direct economic loss equals about 6 million yuan."" Xiao Changan, party chief of Guangli Village, Tongkou County, said.After the outbreak of the flood, villagers were evacuated from dilapidated houses, while channels were dug up to save rice fields. But with heavy rain set to continue, Hunan province faces a daunting task.In southwestern Guiyang city, combined rain and hail left many people trapped. Between Friday night and Saturday morning, 100 different rescue teams were dispatched to help them. Residents were saved from powered-off elevators, out of flooded residential buildings, or out of stranded vehicles. Over 100 trapped residents were rescued.Southern Shenzhen city is also struggling to cope with the largest rainstorm in six years. Local authorities have issued a red warning, and the whole city has started an emergency alert. All middle schools, elementary schools, kindergartens have suspended classes. Workplaces have been advised to suspend or postpone working.Other parts of China have also not been spared from the severe weather. In the coastal city of Qingdao in east China, 18 people were killed and another three injured early Sunday morning after heavy rain caused a wall to collapse. The waterlogged wall fell on a makeshift house for staff at a processing site of a renewable resource company at Huangdao Island. Rescuers rushed to the site and concluded their search on Sunday afternoon. The three injured have been hospitalized.While some areas were drenched in the downpours, others were buried beneath dense snow. Due to a cold front from Siberia, rare snow fell over Shandan and Aksai counties in northwestern China. The snow was somewhat of a mixed blessing, helping relieve a drought in the region but leaving hundreds of drivers stranded on the highways. Local traffic authorities have sent teams to clear the ice and snow from the roads. Traffic is expected to return to normal on Monday."

With ongoing widespread rains in the SADC region the level of the Zambezi river is heading for the 5.50m mark before the beginning of April, which would mean more conditions of flooding in Namibia. Between Monday and Tuesday, the river level stood around 5.05m and 5.1m compared to last year's 5.71m around the same time. According to the Namibia Hydrological Services (NHS) daily bulletin released on Monday, the perennial rivers continue to rise significantly countrywide.""The Zambezi river is maintaining its rapid rise and the river levels in Katima Mulilo have reached the critical range. The overflow in the Zambezi floodplains has started and easy access is inhibited. The Chobe river's spillage is pushing westwards into Liambezi lake,"" the NHS bulletin states.Taking into account the rapid rising water levels, Patrick Kompeli, the agricultural research technician in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry yesterday said the Kalimbeza rice project is also poised for possible flooding within the next week or two, which would cause destruction to property and lead to a possible poor rice harvest.
""There is a possibility of the project being flooded if the river levels keep rising with the next two weeks. Fortunately, we already harvested the short rice varieties - Irga and Angola - last month. At the moment, there is only Supa in the field, which is the tall variety. Supa can normally survive the flood because of its tallness,"" he said. Supa is expected to be harvested around May.
Kompeli anticipated the project would harvest about 50 tonnes of the three rice varieties. ""When you mill, you only get 60 percent of what you have harvested and only that rice can be sold, the rest (40 percent) is broken rice,"" he noted. Milling is expected to start next week once the new milling machine is installed. Further, the NHS also reported very good rains in the Cuvelai delta, with Oshikango being heavily affected by rain. In addition, the Hoarusib, Ugab, Omatako and Cuito catchment areas also received good rains.The NHS cautioned that as a consequence of heavy rains the road between Omafo and Okalongo which is under construction is very bad for driving, the road being slippery and difficult to overtake on.""Flooding in the Cuvelai oshanas are mainly from a combination of localized rainfall, water coming from the head waters in Angola and soil saturation. The floodwaters have passed the northern border and contingency and preparedness plans need to be put into gear or action,"" warns the NHS.The NHS reported that the level of the Orange river on Namibia's southern border has also started to rise because of the flooding observed upstream one week ago, while at Brand Karos the level is rising rapidly.""With the local soils already waterlogged due to good rains over the past weeks, extra flows from upstream of catchments will worsen the flooding situation,"" the NHS cautioned.  ""From 01 March to 18 March 2014 the north-eastern parts of the country experienced heavy and extended rainfall which led to extensive flooding and landslides. As a result, over 7,000 people have been affected, with 3,525 displaced. The government of South Africa confirms 32 deaths have been reported with others still missing due to flash flooding. The most affected provinces include Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and Gauteng.

March 3, 2014:  ""Changes to the Tokwe-Mukosi Dam's design made more than a decade ago could have contributed to the flaws that have caused the displacement thousands of families earlier this year, according to a recent report published by The Financial Gazette of Zimbabwe.

HydroWorld.com reported in February that more than 4,500 residents in areas downstream from Tokwe-Mukosi had been evacuated following heavy rains in Zimbabwe's Masvingo province after water began leaking through cracks in the dam's walls.
According to The Financial Gazette's report, French design firm Coyne et Bellier was first commissioned to provide a study for the dam and a hydropower plant in Fall 1967.
The idea was tabled during decades of political unrest before being resurrected in 1980, with Coyne et Bellier providing further studies in the mid-1980s. The group then proposed a concrete arch dam in 1992, though the design was changed after being deemed too expensive by the Zimbabwe government.
""[The design] was considered excessive and so the Designs Division of the Department of Water Development began a thorough investigation into the Coyne et Bellier design report and came up with a cheaper alternative in the form of a concrete-faced rock-filled dam,"" said a report released in 1998 -- the same year in which construction of Tokwe-Mukosi finally began.
The Zimbabwe National Water Authority has since said that Tokwe-Mukosi -- which is still being constructed -- will not collapse, though thousands of evacuees are still being sheltered in refugee camps sponsored by a number of multi-national relief organizations."

The floods had inundated 5,000 houses, 450 classrooms and seven health units. Roads in the two districts had become impassable.Taking the country as a whole, Banze said said that 5,000 families had been affected by heavy rains and flooding since the rainy season began in October.He said the government is seriously concerned at outbreaks of cholera reported in Zambezia and the neighbouring province of Nampula. 43 cases had been diagnosed, but so far there were no deaths.?Civic education and water purification measures are being taken so that other people are not affected by the disease?, said Banze.The government is continuing to monitor the situation, he added, and will take measures to ensure that the food and health needs of flood victims are met.The weather forecast for the next few days is continued rainfall throughout the country, but particularly in the central and northern provinces.However, there should be a slackening of the rains in the neighbouring countries where most of the major Mozambican rivers rise. Hence it is likely that the levels of those rivers will fall.?We must continue to monitor the northern and central zones because of the continuing heavy rains.

The Jakarta administration and its neighboring districts announced various plans and projects, which are already operational or planned to be implemented, in order to deal with the inundation problem.Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, recently claimed that the capital city has built 1,900 absorption wells, while around two million wells are, in fact needed, to curb flooding.Out of 884 sewers and small rivers existing in the city, his administration has managed to clean up just 160 of them. Jokowi stated that he also plans to return the upstream area of the Ciliwung River in Puncak, Bogor, West Java, to its natural habitat as a water catchment area to prevent flooding in Jakarta, since the floodwaters mostly arise from the Bogor District.""The floodwaters have indeed come here (Jakarta) from the area above (the upstream area of Ciliwung river). That is what needs to be overcome. The root problem lies there,"" he recently noted.The governor further explained that the citys public works office will focus on constructing river dikes, since one of the main factors that triggered the floods so far, are the weak condition of the dykes. ""Therefore, this year, the public works office will focus on constructing dikes along the river banks,"" he emphasized, while inspecting a dike on the banks of the Ciliwung River.A new dike is being built on the western side of the Ciliwung River to curb floods and robs. On the occasion, Jokowi planted four trees along the Ciliwung River.

In 2011, Thailand suffered its worst flooding in half a century. More than 800 people were killed and 6 million hectares (14.8 million acres) of agricultural, industrial and residential lands were devastated. Many of the country's industrial estates, which export electronic parts, auto parts and hard disk drives, were swamped, as were large parts of Bangkok.
Authorities have downplayed concerns of a repeat.
""Thanks to the dredging of the canals and the weather, at this point there is nothing to panic about,"" Bangkok Gov. Sukhumbhand Paribatra tweeted Monday night. ""Currently the water level in the Chao Phraya River is still low, so there's nothing to worry.""
Experts also say it is unlikely the capital will see major flooding this year.
""It is not worrisome as the situation is very different from 2011,"" said Seree Supratid, the director of a climate and disaster center at Bangkok's Rangsit University. ."

But flood defences and evacuation warnings meant that only two people were killed in storm-related accidents.Accidents linked to the storm that roared across Europe have killed at least eight people, from Britain to Sweden, Denmark and Poland.Traffic ground to a halt on icy highways and train service was cancelled in large parts of Sweden. Tens of thousands of people lost electricity. Strong winds knocked down the city of Vaxjo's Christmas tree.Scores of flights were cancelled at airports in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Poland. More than 1000 people spent the night at Copenhagen Airport where 200 flights were cancelled Thursday and about 70 on Friday.Strong winds threatened a collection of Viking ships recovered from the bottom of a Danish fjord in the 1960s and put on exhibition.Museum workers boarded up the expansive windows of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, west of Copenhagen, amid fears water from the fjord would rise and shatter the glass.Police in Denmark ordered the evacuation of people in the towns of Frederikssund and Frederiksvaerk, northeast of Copenhagen, because of imminent flooding. The towns lie on the Roskilde fjord, which has seen water levels rise noticeably.Hamburg Airport, where almost all flights were cancelled on Friday, was open for business but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow.Trains northward from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled.Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory. But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days have meant the impact of this week's storm on the city has been negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life.Meanwhile, wind farms in Germany reaped benefits from the storm. The country's vast network of on- and offshore wind turbines produced 25,205.8 MW of electricity, the equivalent of 25 nuclear plants and almost 35 per cent of the country's total energy output in one hour""  Some flooding in Rotterdam, Dordrecht as storm clean-up begins. December 6, 2013: ""A number of streets close to the river in Rotterdam and Dordrecht have been flooded following the combination of strong winds and high tides, according to media reports on Friday.The water is up to knee-high in parts of Rotterdam close to the rivers and areas of Dordrecht's historic centre are under water. There are also reports of localised flooding in nearby Maasluis.A temporary dyke on the Oude Maas river under the Botlekbrug broke through over a three-metre stretch on Friday morning, leading to traffic diversions. The dyke had been built because of roadworks on the bridge.In Zeeland, the water level along the main sea dykes reached 3.99 metres above normal, the highest recorded since the great storm of 1953 which killed nearly two thousand people.Weather forecasters say winds remain strong in coastal areas and there will localised snow and hail showers at times.The emergency services received 2,700 calls about damage during the height of the storm, as it moved over the Netherlands between 16.00 and 20.00 hours.

The most recent death toll stands at more than 100 and it is estimated that over 100,000 livestock have been lost, threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people.The Somali Red Crescent Society mobilized its volunteers to evacuate people to safer ground and to provide first aid services. Volunteers are also collecting and burying dead livestock in an effort to stave off the breakout of disease.
As water levels began receding and roads became passable, the Somali Red Crescent Society dispatched two mobile health clinics and an additional vehicle to support rescue operations.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is also stepping in to assist with emergency response efforts.

""IFRC has deployed a team to assist the Somali Red Crescent to carry out assessments and initial response in the northeast area of Puntland,"" said Kwame Darko, health delegate for IFRC's Somalia delegation.

""We also sent in non-food items such as kitchen sets, tarpaulins, blankets, sleeping mats, jerry cans and soap, initially for 100 families. We will increase this based on the assessment results.""

With fears of an outbreak of waterborne diseases, the IFRC will also deploy a water and sanitation specialist from the Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT), as well as a health specialist from the Somali Red Crescent to take part in the assessment mission. The full RDRT remains on stand-by to be deployed to Puntland and Somaliland if needed.

This week's efforts will be concentrated in carrying out assessments in the eight most affected districts in the Nugal and Bari regions. Relief items will then be distributed based on the needs of affected families.

This cyclone is just one of the many silent disasters occurring around the world, most of which usually go unreported in international media and are often out of the public eye, failing to attract sufficient funding and resources to provide essential humanitarian aid. However, for those affected, the consequences are catastrophic with lives and livelihoods lost.

AUSTIN ? It's a Halloween nightmare that won't go away.Tirso Perez awoke to find shin-high water streaming into his living room. Outside, walls of water washed over his street and rolled into his lawn.A week later, Perez's neighborhood and many others are still reeling from the flooding as residents and volunteers dig out from the mud-caked destruction.After propping up his two Chihuahuas ? Chico and Gizmo ? on a bed, Perez, 76, and his wife, Maria, 72, pushed their way to their front lawn and into waist-high water. It was the beginning of a harrowing three-hour ordeal that ended with rescue crews in a boat plucking the pair from a neighbor's roof.""I've lived here 30-something years and never seen anything like that,"" said Perez, a retired state worker.This week, residents tried to locate tool sheds, cars and pets that floated miles away in the flood. Others pulled soggy sheetrock from homes.Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell declared a local state of disaster Monday.The neighborhoods near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport were overwhelmed in the early morning hours of Oct. 31 when water from nearby Onion Creek surged past its banks and rolled into their streets, filling homes within minutes.They were caught in a historic flash flood with more force and volume of water than the city has ever seen. The flood killed at least four people ? including a woman and her 8-month-old son who were swept away in their car ? damaged more than 1,200 homes and sent hundreds of residents fleeing to higher ground.A torrential rainstorm that stalled over a limestone watershed prone to flash floods led to the flooding, said Wendy Morgan, a city spokeswoman. Onion Creek rose 11 feet in 15 minutes and crested at a record 41 feet, sending walls of water into surrounding neighborhoods. The previous record for Onion Creek, set in 1869 and again in 1921, was 38 feet, Morgan said.The recent flood had a flow rate of 120,000 cubic feet per second ? nearly twice the force of Niagara Falls, she said.""It was flattening trees. It was moving boulders. It was pushing cars around like they were pieces of paper,"" Morgan said. ""It was a huge volume of water. There was no standing up to this flood.""""I'm still in shock,"" said Carmen Perez, Tirso Perez's daughter, who lost a home on the same street as her father. ""It all happened within 15 minutes. It was that fast.""Immediately after the flood, the American Red Cross of Central Texas opened two shelters that accepted 60 displaced residents, said Jose Dominguez, a spokesman with the group. That number has since dwindled to 45, he said. The Red Cross has not received any state or federal funding, he said.""The biggest need right now is permanent housing,"" Dominguez said. ""It happened in the middle of the night. People didn't expect to be woken up to such devastation.""The water started to flow into neighborhoods around 5 a.m. Oct. 31 and intensified until around 10 a.m., Morgan said. The water came on so hard and fast that it overwhelmed two river sensors in Onion Creek, she said. Emergency response teams were dispatched to manually measure the rising water.Earlier that morning, the National Weather Service had issued a flash flood emergency warning for the area ? the first one Austin has ever received, she said.""We knew we had a record flood coming,"" Morgan said. ""What surprised us was the volume of water.""Emergency officials were thrown off because they had endured a drought for so long, said Toni Grasso, another Austin spokeswoman. ""It overwhelmed our resources,"" Grasso said of the flood. ""No one anticipated this.""Viola Brown was asleep the morning of the flood when a neighbor called to say water was rising against her front door. She should come to the neighbor's two-story home, the neighbor said.Brown, 70, packed her glasses, keys and a change of clothes into a plastic bag and headed to the neighbor's house. Halfway there, a surge of water knocked her down. She crawled to a stop sign, stood and held on for the next three hours, singing church hymns and praying as the water rose to her chest, she said.""I thought, 'This will pass soon,'"" Brown said. ""But it didn't.""Instead, the current strengthened, ferrying branches, uprooted trees and the tops of submerged cars past her, she said. Dogs and deer paddled frantically in the dark water around her.Finally, an Austin police helicopter spotted her and lowered a rescue worker on a cable to her. He wrapped her in an emergency lifesaver and hoisted her to the helicopter, which flew her to higher ground. For now, Brown sleeps on an air mattress at a Red Cross shelter. She's debating whether to try to rebuild her home or move to Houston with family members. Mostly, she's happy to be alive, she said.""God brought me through that,"" Brown said. ""He'll bring me through something else."

The flooding, mudslides and highway blockages due to intense rains spread Sunday to the Peruvian regions of Ancash, Cuzco, Huanuco and Pasco with thousands of people reported to be affected, officials said.Ten kilometers (6.2 miles) of the highway linking the town of Kepashiato with the Valley of the Apurimac and Ene rivers, or VRAE, region are covered with mud and stones from landslides in recent hours, the governor of La Convencion, a province in the Cuzco region, Oscar Rodriguez Monterroso, told Radio Programs del Peru, or RPP.?There are businessmen and people who are making trips and domestic tourists who are visiting the archaeological sanctuary of Machu Picchu through this zone and who, upon becoming stranded, have had to walk for several hours,? the governor said.
Last year, the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu was affected by the overflowing of the Vilcanota River and had to closed to the public for two months so that the train line leading to it, which had been damaged by flooding, could be repaired.
Officials, however, so far have not said that they are going to have to take measures of this kind at Machu Picchu, which this year will celebrate the 100th year of its discovery.Fifty towns in Ancash located on the so-called Huaylas and Conchucos routes have been rendered incommunicado by several mudslides that buried the roads this past week, emergency management officials told the El Comercio newspaper.In Ancash, one of the country?s main tourist attractions, the snow-covered Pastoruri mountain has reduced its schedule for visits by mountaineers to just the morning hours because of the presence later in the day of electrical storms and heavy rain.Meanwhile, in the region of Huanuco, the overflowing of the Pachitea River has left 550 people affected in the Yuyapichis district, in the province of Puerto Inca, because of the flooding of 110 homes, as well as an unknown number of crop fields.In the region of Pasco, at least 65 communities in the districts of Puerto Bermudez and Ciudad Constitucion remain under water after the overflowing of the Pichis River, emergency management officials said.The intense rains have prevented the operation of helicopters in the area to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid, forcing the emergency management office to send some 25 tons of food, clothing, and construction materials by land.There are 5,000 people affected in Pasco between those who lost their homes and all their possessions and others who suffered more minor damage, but all of them need food and medical attention to prevent the spread of disease, officials said.."""

Over 2.5 lakh people have been marooned in Balasore, which along with Mayurbhanj, are the worst-hit.
Here are the latest developments: 
The situation in Balasore ""is critical,"" according to PK Mohapatra, the state's Special Relief Commissioner, as flood waters from the Budhabalanga and Subarnarekha rivers inundated scores of villages.
Nearly half of Baripada town in the neighbouring Mayurbhanj district has also been submerged due to a worrying rise in water levels in the river.
Teams from the Army, Navy and Air Force, besides central disaster management agencies, have been deployed for rescue and relief operations in region. ""We are starting air-dropping of food packets in Balasore district immediately... The flood situation in the district is a cause of concern,"" state Revenue and Disaster Management Minister SN Patro said. (Read)
The death toll in the state due to the impact of the cyclone has risen to 27 after four people were killed today due to the floods in Mayurbhanj and Bhadrak districts.
Three villages in Ganjam district, which bore the maximum brunt of the monster storm which hit the state on Saturday evening, have also been completely submerged, stranding nearly 10,000 people. A local MLA in the district has, in fact, demanded for the Army and Air Force to be called in to evacuate people. (Track updates)
Power services in Ganjam have been completely wrecked, while five lakh homes have been partially or completely destroyed. ""It will take us a minimum of one week, maybe even two weeks to get power back,"" collector of Ganjam district Krishan Kumar said.
The loss arising out of the devastation unleashed by the cyclone has been pegged at more than Rs. 3,000 crore in Ganjam alone. Fishermen have suffered massive losses as their nets, boats and catamarans have been damaged, the Collector said. (Full coverage)
Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who visited relief camps in the cyclone-ravaged district today, was greeted by angry villagers who complained against lack of relief materials and demanded compensation. He has ordered payment of Rs. 500 each to those affected even as the administration will begin distribution of ration that will be supplied free of cost for the next two months. ""We will provide them money for rehabilitation and for crop damage... We are taking care of drinking water supply,"" he said.
Mr Patnaik also spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today and informed him about the post-cyclone situation and the state government's initiatives to bring back normalcy in the affected districts. He also requested the PM for technical support of Central power sector units for restoration of the power infrastructure in the state.
A part of National Highway 5, connecting Kolkata and Chennai, was blocked by several villagers today who were also agitating against the lack of relief material. Bhubaneswar: An unprecedented and timely evacuation drive, said to be the country's biggest ever, ensured minimum casualties as Cyclone Phailin slammed into coastal Odisha on Saturday evening. 23 people, including two in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, have died in the aftermath of the ""very severe"" storm, which has since weakened.

""The first priority was to save precious human lives and to a great extent we have achieved that,"" Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik told NDTV. (Watch) But now, with Phailin moving further inland, there is flood threat in Mayurbhanj and Baripada districts of Odisha and neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.

As Phailin passed through Odisha, nearly half of Baripada town was submerged due to a rise in water levels in the river, causing panic among the people. Several villages too were inundated as river Baitarani rose past the danger mark.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the cyclone is now closer to Chhattisgarh-Odisha border and very heavy rains are expected over north Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, east Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim in the next 48 hours. (Read)

Heavy rains and surging seawater, accompanying Phailin, the strongest storm to hit the country in more than a decade, flattened tens of thousands of thatched homes, destroyed more than five lakh hectares of crops and knocked out power lines in Odisha.

The worst affected area, around the coastal town of Gopalpur where the eye of Phailin came ashore packing winds of 200 kilometres an hour, was still without power as emergency services rushed to help people living there. Hundreds of workers from the country's National Disaster Response Force fanned out across the region, clearing away fallen trees from roads, mangled power poles and other debris.

The Indian Meteorological Department or IMD, whose predictions for the cyclone were consistently below those from foreign meteorologists who foresaw higher wind speeds and greater damage, comparable to the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, stood vindicated. (Read)

""After the exaggerated manner in which international agencies tried to portray it (the cyclone and disaster), the IMD has done an excellent job,"" said M Shashidhar Reddy, vice chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority."

But flooding was reported all along the Front Range, from Colorado Springs to north of Fort Collins.
Capt. John Burt of the Colorado State Patrol said a storm cell moved over the mountains during the night, headed east over the Plains, then circled back around. The National Weather Service warned of an ""extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation"" throughout the region as the flooding forced people from their homes and caused mud and rockslides in some areas.""Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life,"" the Weather Service warned throughout the morning.Boulder Office of Emergency Management spokeswoman Gabrielle Boerkircher said many roads were blocked and volunteers were trying to help stranded people until emergency crews could arrive.
Boerkircher told The Associated Press one person was killed when a structure collapsed in the tiny town of Jamestown. Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said another person was also found dead in northern Boulder.
""We're trying to get to Jamestown,"" Boerkircher said of a mountain community northwest of Boulder. ""A lot of towns need assistance, and we cannot get through.""Two other structures in the area were also damaged and may have collapsed.
To the south, Colorado Springs spokeswoman Kim Melchor said police conducting flood patrols found a body in Fountain Creek on the west side of the city early Thursday.
National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Kleyla said a 20-foot wall of water was reported in Left Hand Canyon north of Boulder, and a firefighter radioed he was trapped in a tree. He said rescuers were trying to get through, but were blocked by debris.
In Broomfield, U.S. Highway 287 collapsed when a culvert washed out, dumping three vehicles into the rushing water. Three people were rescued and had minor injuries.
Near Lyons, about 2 feet of water was standing on U.S. Highway 36 as a normally shallow creek known for trout fishing flooded its banks.
At least one earthen dam gave way southeast of Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, and water levels could rise downstream as authorities release more water to keep more dams from giving way.
A National Guard helicopter requested to help pull people from their homes hasn't been able to take off because of fog and low cloud cover throughout the area.
Flash flood warnings were issued for multiple counties in the region, including Jamestown and the Fourmile wildfire burn area.
Flash flood emergencies were also issued downstream from the Front Range mountain areas, including Fort Lupton, Dacono, Plateville and other farming areas as debris piled up near bridges.
An evacuation center for the mountain residents has been sent up in nearby Nederland, officials said.
Meanwhile, about 400 students in a dorm at the University of Colorado in Boulder were evacuated and classes were canceled Thursday and Friday because of the flooding.
Mudslides and rockslides were reported in several areas, with parts of U.S. 6, Boulder Canyon, Colorado 14 and U.S. 287 all reporting problems and temporary blockages during the evening Lefthand Canyon was reported blocked by one of the many slides.

In Russia: ""Floods affecting a big swathe of Russia's far east will cost the authorities billions of roubles in compensation - payments that could have been avoided if lessons had been learnt from similar disasters in the past.

The Amur and Zeya rivers, near the Chinese border, burst their banks near the town of Blagoveshchensk after torrential rain.

""Thirty years of dry weather made people forgetful, and they started building in places where there is a risk of flooding,"" says Pyotr Osipov, an ecologist for the environmental group WWF in the Amur region.

He remembers the record flooding of 1984, when the Zeya spilled across a wider area than today. But since then more villages and towns have grown up along the banks. Somehow people believed there would be no more floods.

""We had the river pouring deep into the floodplains, as far as 15km (nine miles). It is no surprise, as the river bed formed over thousands of years without human involvement,"" Mr Osipov says.

He argues that the authorities should have moved people from risky areas long ago. Now they will have to do it anyway - but also spend money on compensation.

Lawyer Boris Burdeyev looks at floods
Lawyer Boris Burdeyev says people were let down by complacent local officials
Boris Burdeyev, a 30-year-old lawyer, is outraged. ""Why did they give permission to build here?"" he asks.

His house, in the village of Vladimirovka near Blagoveshchensk, used to be a long way from the river, but is now submerged up to its windows.

""This isn't some kind of shanty town - all the houses were built legally, with official approval,"" he says. He built his home four years ago at a cost of about 3m roubles (œ58,000; $91,000). He does not know if it will be habitable after the water subsides.

Local authorities are paying about $300 each to those forced to flee affected areas. There is a promise of more compensation to come from the central government. It all depends on the value of their lost property and possessions, and could stretch to tens of thousands of dollars per person.

Threat of looting
But Yelena, who works for a local nursery, cannot say how much she will get in compensation, if anything.

""You have to prove what property you had, you have to present papers, photos.""

Although herself a flood victim, she helps other evacuees, who have been temporarily housed in a nursery school. Her own house, which she and her husband built in Vladimirovka, is now under water.

It was made of timber and was too close to the river, she says. A brick house would have survived, but theirs will be totally ruined.

There is more to worry about than the floodwaters. ""Looters are already working hard,"" says Yekaterina from the village of Grodekovo.

For the past 10 days she and her child have been staying at the nursery where Yelena works. Yekaterina's parents are still in the flooded village. ""They practically live up on the roof, surrounded by chickens, rabbits? and looters,"" she said.

But local residents say looting incidents have been rare. Grigory Nikishin, director of a holiday village in Belogorye, 20km upstream from Blagoveshchensk, said: ""We had a few attempts in the first days of flooding, but our security people and police chased them off.""

However, he decided to stay behind with several employees to keep watch over half-submerged buildings. ""All the ground-floor rooms are under water. The floors, tiling, linoleum is going to be ruined. All will have to be redone,"" he said.

Heavy rains lashing China's northeast and Russia's far east have not only unleashed massive floods but also looked to have stirred up bad blood, as the neighbours accuse each other of channelling unwanted water across the border.

The worst flooding seen in years has affected 3.7 million people and caused at least 72 deaths in China's northeast and prompted the evacuation of up to 100,000 in the Russian region.

Torrential rain in the past few weeks has burst the banks of the Amur River, which is called Heilongjiang in Chinese. The river runs through both countries and forms the border between the Chinese province of the same name and Russia's Amur, Khabarovsk and Jewish autonomous areas.

State broadcaster China Central TV (CCTV) said Russia's release of floodwater into the Amur has exacerbated the situation downstream in China. The water level of Heilongjiang near Jiayin county has risen by 30cm daily since August 7, CCTV reported last Saturday.

Some Chinese netizens have also hit out at Russia. ""Treating our Heilongjiang province as a reservoir for flood water. What a great ally!"" wrote a netizen nicknamed ""The Happy Life Of A Ghost"" on Sina microblog, referring to Russia.

Said Ma Airong, 50, a hostel owner from Heilongjiang's Mohe county bordering Russia: ""When they release water from their reservoir, we are affected.""

Four years ago, she told The Straits Times, she and other villagers were forced to flee to higher ground to escape the rising water.

Russian officials, in turn, have pointed the finger at China.

Vladimir Stepanov, head of Russia's National Crisis Management Centre, said in Moscow last week that most of the water causing the floods came from China, according to the Voice of Russia. If China keeps releasing water from its reservoirs into the Amur River, water levels could rise by 50 per cent, he added.

As of Sunday, 8pm Russian time, the Amur River near the city of Khabarovsk hit 6.49m, the highest since 1897. Radio Free Europe quoted Russia's chief health inspector Gennady Onishchenko, who warned on Sunday that flood waters from contaminated rivers in China are bringing harmful microbes and pollutants into the region.

However, Beijing played down talk of discord, with the Ministry of Water Resources saying on Sunday that both sides are working well together to fight the disaster. It noted that water inflow into Bureya Reservoir, in Russia's Far East, reached 5,050 cubic m per second last Friday, but Russia kept it at around 1,000 cubic m per second. 

""When flooding hit its Zeya and Bureya rivers, (Russia) made a strong effort to hold the flooding in its reservoirs, greatly reducing the flood pressure on the main stream of the Heilongjiang,"" it said in comments carried by China Daily."

Comments:  Heavy rains have resulted in a significant increase in the Parana river flow in Brazil, increasing pressure on the reservoir of the Itaipu dam, which releases water flow onto Paraguayan territory. This situation affects people located in the low areas of Paran? or close to the river beds in the Departments of Alto Paran?, Misiones, Itap?a and ?eembuc?. The situation is further aggravated due to the convergence of the Parana and Paraguay rivers which is flooding surrounding communities such as Paso de Patria, Mayor Martinez, Cerrito, Villalb?n and General D?az. Meteorological reports predict continued rains in the basin of the Igua?u and Parana rivers for the next few days, specifically in the departments of Canindey?, Alto Paran?, while Brazil's Parana state could receive more moderate rainfall. In response to the floods, the executive board of the Paraguayan Government has issued the Decree No. 11.313 by which ?Emergency is declared in Misiones, High Paran? and ?eembuc? departments affected by flooding and water overloads of water runways and emergency measures are taken"" for 90 days from 27 June 2013.

Last week the Paran  river in Paraguay broke its banks and the floods forced 800 people from their homes. The Paran  runs along the border between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil. Heavy rainfall, at around 10cm per day, has been falling for around 10 days in the region.

There are now reports that the heavy rains that swelled the levels of the Paran  have also brought water levels in the Iguaz£ river to high levels. The flow of the Paran  is said to be 3 times the norm, and the Iguaz£ is as much as 11 times higher than the normal flow at this time of year.

Flooding has now affected various parts of Argentina, including the provinces of Corrientes, Chaco and Santa Fe. Reports claim that around 10,000 people have been evacuated from the area while the river levels pose such a threat. Evacuation teams made up of police, fire department staff and volunteers have been helping with the evacuations. Those displaced have been taken to relief camps on higher ground.

The floods haven also hit the world famous Iguaz£ Park in Argentina, home of the Iguaz£ Falls, forcing the authorities to close parts of the national park to visitors on 27th June and dangerous areas ? most of the walkways around the ?Garganta del Diablo? track ? will remain closed until it is deemed safe enough for tourists to return. Walkways over the river have been covered in debris and flood water. All sightseeing boat tours have also been suspended. The floods and high river levels are expected to last around 7 days."

We are quite a resourceful lot.""City authorities have said it is still too early to estimate the costs of the floods in southern Alberta that left three people dead, devastated entire communities and forced at least 100,000 people from their homes in Calgary and elsewhere.But they will far exceed C$400 million ($381 million) in damage caused by a flood in 2005, known at the time as the ""flood of the century"".Although 60 percent of the downtown area now has power, Gianna Manes, chief executive of utility Enmax, said full restoration would take a number of days, given that tTwo lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway have opened west of Calgary after flooding destroyed part of the roadway near Canmore last week.""While this is the first step, we are in it for the long haul,"" said Alberta Transportation Minister Ric McIver.He said there remains a number of challenges in rebuilding highways, homes and communities throughout southern Alberta.Officials are warning drivers that the highway is still not in top condition and the speed limit has been lowered to 60 km/h.Elderly woman drowned in her homeA Calgary woman who was found dead her home in an evacuation zone died of drowning, an autopsy has confirmed.The 83-year-old woman was found by friends in her Erlton home Sunday. They had returned to check on her at her ground level residence.She had been contacted by police in person last Thursday about the mandatory evacuation, and all indications are that the woman was going to comply with the order.?Certainly this is tragedy for the family, for the friends, for the neighbours of the woman who passed away,? said Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi at a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.It was also announced Wednesday that the state of emergency in Calgary would be extended for eight more days, bringing the total of 21.?What that means is that we continue to have the ability to respond quickly, and flexibly,? said Nenshi.A state of emergency means that a municipality can circumvent bylaws, implement lane reversals on roads and spend money without pre-approval by council.The provincial act also gives the city power to conscript resources as needed.When explaining what that means, Nenshi used the example of a fence that needs reinforcing.?We can go to the Home Depot and steal their fence, and use it without asking,? said Nenshi.Power updates
Enmax CEO Gianna Manes said Wednesday afternoon that Mission, Cliff Bungalow, Beltline and Victoria Park are all expected to have power restored by 10 p.m. MT.""Certain buildings in this area may still have water in the basement and those individual buildings will not be able to have power to them until the building is dry,"" said Manes.In the downtown core, five out of seven power zones had been re-energized, though only 30 per cent of buildings are ready to have power restored.Across the city, there are still at least 11,000 people out of their homes, down from 100,000 at the peak of the crisis.Water tables a stumbling block
?We?re starting to see the water tables start to drop, which stops the continued infiltration, where as soon as you pump something up it fills back up,? said Bruce Burrell, Calgary Emergency Management Agency director.But Burrell warned that progress is likely to slow down. He compared progress to sponges, where work done up to now was like squeezing out a damp sponge and work being done now is like dealing with a sopping wet sponge.McLeod Trail, a major Calgary road leading into downtown, was reopened at 6:30 a.m. MT, but Memorial Drive and all bridges over Elbow River remain closed, said Burrell.Eighty per cent of roads have been reopened across the city, said Burrell on Wednesday morning.The Bow is still flowing at three times its normal rate, double the rate in 2005, said Nenshi.Towing in flood-affected areas
The city will start towing vehicles that are blocking access for flood-support equipment in affected areas.City officials are now asking people to go to nine Community Support Centres that have been set up, rather than tape paper requests to their homes. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)Previously, people had been told to put a sign in their window or make a 311 request if they needed to have power restored or water pumped out of their home.Now the city is asking people to stop putting signs in their windows, and instead to access one of nine Community Support Centres that were set up Wednesday morning. Requests through the 311 phone line or app will still be processed, but Burrell suggested that the centres would be more responsive because they are in the communities where requests originate.The centres will have representatives from Calgary police, fire, water resources, waste and recycling, development and building approvals and ATCO for utility and energy needs.They have been set up in communities most ravaged by the floods and will be open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. MT, said Burrell.Sewage in the Bow RiverThe flooding has forced the city to dump raw sewage into the Bow River.The Bonnybrook Wastewater Treatment Plant was inundated with floodwater, say city officials.Mayor Naheed Nenshi said the city's other two plants are still operating, but municipalities downstream have been warned about the problems at Bonnybrook.?There is some sewage discharge into the river, which is not uncommon in conditions like this, and the important thing is the folks downstream know how to deal with it, just as we're dealing with it when it comes to us from upstream.?The city says the Bonnybrook plant is not meeting provincial standards right now, and it's working with Alberta Environment on the problem.Nenshi said the city?s two other plants are operating safely and communities downstream have been warned about the problem.

Two people were swept away by the swollen Indravati Saturday.
Reports from Bastar, Dantewada and Bijapur districts, confirm that at least 8,000 people have been marooned by the floods.

The high-altitude road that is several kilometers long and considered the lifeline for reaching the border areas in this difficult terrain has been damaged at various points. At many places, it has just been washed away, at others, big boulders have broken down the road completely.The ghosts of 1962 war are still dancing in these parts of the border. The treacherous terrain, and the recent landslides, have yet again exposed the extreme folly of not developing the region because of a lopsided fear of Chinese military waves sweeping in through good roads. It was the defeat by the Chinese military that prompted the government not to develop road networks along the China border, but today that decision is haunting the lives of thousands and strategic military posts.
According to local sources, the only way to approach the border posts now is through helicopters, which is also not very easy considering that it is a difficult, high-terrain area. Alternate routes on the treacherous terrain is also very difficult, and not sufficient to carry a large number of Army men or supplies.
When asked for its comments, Army headquarters in New Delhi said the Dharali-Nelong stretch, north of Harsil, has witnessed landslides which are normal there. It said all the roads in the area have been washed away, but ""foot movement and connectivity are there"".Officers who were on their way to the post have been stranded and are currently helping in relief and rescue operations at Harsil, one of the last cantonment areas in the region. Sources said while adequate supplies and ration was there at the post, a delay in constructing the road could lead to constraints going forward.The bad weather in the area and the difficult terrain is expected to make this task difficult, and with the monsoon rains around, not much headway is expected here. With winter setting in thereafter, it gets more difficult as the whole area gets engulfed in heavy snow.Sources said a team specially brought in to construct bunkers in the border post had also been stranded. These have Army men from the Engineers Corps.The story of Nelong's single road and its destruction represents the strategic fallouts of deadly rains and landslides of last week. The single most important road on the Badrinath stretch, Rishikesh-Joshimath-Badrinath-Mana road is also broken at various locations. The story isn't very different in other stretches in Uttarakhand. And on the rest of the border with China, it would only take a heavy downpour to expose the poor Indian infrastructure, compared to the sleek connectivity up to the last post on the China side"". Thousands stranded in parts of northern India awaited rescuers on Wednesday as floods caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains killed at least 150 people in worst-hit Uttarakhand.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a 10-billion-rupee aid package for the state after he and Congress president Sonia Gandhi did an aerial survey of the flood-hit region.?The government will not spare any effort in rescue and relief operations,? Singh said on his official Twitter account, adding the large-scale devastation they witnessed was ?most distressing?.?The priority for the authorities at the moment is to rescue the stranded and provide urgently needed succour to those most in need of it,? he said.This year, the rains are at least twice as heavy in northwest and central India as the annual monsoon rains covered the whole country faster than usual....

The good news is that the water level of Bhagirathi in Uttarkashi and Ganga in Rishikesh had begun to recede and rains may reduce in next three days. Meanwhile, the holy temple town of Kedarnath was the worst hit by floods and thousands of tourists were stranded in adverse weather conditions. Three ITBP personnel and two policemen were killed during a rescue operation in Kedarnath. Uttarkashi, which is transit point for pilgrimage to Kedarnath and Badrinath was also badly hit. The town witness another bridge over river Bhagirathi being washed away. Nearly 200 camps have been set up for those stranded.

He said food, medicines and blankets were air-dropped in remote areas of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh for the flood-affected people. ""We have provided seven helicopters to Uttarakhand. The state government has also hired four private helicopters. We are providing helicopters to Himachal Pradesh. Hopefully, all stranded people will be evacuated today,"" Singh said. Due to bad weather, the helicopters started operating only this morning. 50 pilgrims have been rescued from Kedarnath and brought to Gupt Kashi. Further sorties are in progress to evacuate the stranded. Highways linking Delhi and Haridwar, Rishikesh and Yamunotri and Gangotri and the Badrinath National Highway are blocked for now.

The monsoon generally hits north India by June end. But the movement of clouds was such that the entire country was covered with monsoon by June 16, a good month ahead of its schedule date for the first time since 1961. The rains caught everyone napping and brought about miseries to thousand of pilgrims, who would have normally finished their pilgrimage by month-end. Meanwhile, intensity of rains will come down in the next 3-4 days, and bring respite to the region."" ""At least 23 people have been killed in northern India after torrential rain and flooding led to homes plunging into the River Ganges and roads being washed away.More than a dozen people died in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand state, while another 50 people were missing, said officials.A landslide triggered by the monsoon rains, which arrived weeks ahead of schedule, buried a bus, killing three in Almora district.Heavy rains eroded the soil along the swollen river, plunging several houses into the water.At least three people were washed away when a three-storey apartment building toppled into the water and was carried away by the swift-moving current, said government spokesman Amit Chandola.Many residents in the town of Yamunagar in northern Haryana state said they were trapped by the floods.The death toll from flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rain in northern India has risen to 70, media reports say.At least 45 people have died in Uttarakhand state, while flood-related deaths have also been reported in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

The operation became necessary due to continued flooding of several villages behind the break. It appears to have been successful.The fight against the record floods that have struck Germany over the last two weeks is largely over, with rivers having returned to their banks and clean-up well underway. But in one part of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, the battle continued over the weekend -- and it was one in which authorities were forced to come up with an unorthodox method to plug a breach in an Elbe River dike just east of Berlin.On Saturday, two barges were sunk using explosives at a gap in a levee in an attempt to stop floodwaters from continuing to flow into the countryside. On Sunday, an additional barge was sunk at the site to block up the final 20 meters (66 feet) of the 90 meter breach. Helicopters carrying oversized sandbags and pieces of concrete then filled in around the sunken boats. Officials on Sunday evening said that the gap had been 80 percent sealed as a result of the operation.
The spectacular fix became necessary after the dike gave way last week, flooding several small towns behind the dike and resulting in thousands of people being evacuated. Now that the water has ceased flowing from the swollen Elbe through the gap in the levee, the flooded area behind it has begun to slowly shrink. Still, some 145 square kilometers of land (56 square miles) remain under water.
It was the first time ever in Germany that sunken ships were used to plug a hole in a dike. The barges were carefully maneuvered into place before explosives on board were detonated so as to ground the craft. Then, several helicopters began flying gigantic sacks of sand to the site to prevent the barges from drifting away.""It was an extremely difficult and risky operation,"" Saxony-Anhalt Governor Reiner Haselhoff told German news agency DPA. ""But we had to do something and to try everything in our power to stop the water.""
Captain Thomas Peter, who maneuvered the barges into position, said: ""We'd never done such a thing before. But we're not crazy. We were able to half-way assess the situation.""Elsewhere on the Elbe River on Monday, officials reported that water levels were well down from their peaks and were continuing to drop.""

PRAGUE, June 3 (Reuters) - Volunteers piled up sandbags to keep a swollen river from overwhelming the Czech capital's historic centre on Monday after floods across central Europe forced factories to closed, drove thousands from their homes and killed at least eight people.Six people died in the Czech Republic from the worst flooding in a decade and a state of emergency was declared, while in Austria two people died and another two were missing.The flooding, which also affected parts of Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, sent shares in reinsurers Munich Re and Hannover Re down by about 2.5 percent, with markets anticipating big claims from property owners once the waters recede.The flooding arose from several days of torrential rainfall. In some places two months worth of rain fell in just a few days.Carmaker Volkswagen temporarily shut its plant in Zwickau, in the eastern German state of Saxony, because the flooding stopped workers reaching the factory.In the centre of the west German town of Passau, people took off their shoes and rolled up their trousers to walk through the ankle-deep water.The last time central Europe saw similar floods was in 2002, when 17 people were killed in the Czech Republic, and damage estimated at 20 billion euros ($26 billion) was inflicted.Officials in Prague, the Czech capital listed by the U.N. cultural agency as a World Heritage Site, said they did not anticipate the waters of the Vltava river would reach 2002 levels.But they were taking no chances. They shut the metro system and, in streets near the river, soldiers put up metal fences - the sort of flood defences ordered after the disaster 11 years ago. Elsewhere, volunteers built walls of sandbags.Tigers at Prague zoo were tranquilised and moved out of an enclosure at risk from flooding.Czech officials said the flood defences in Prague should hold, but that the river level was likely to rise again on Tuesday morning. ""The story is not yet over here,"" said Czech Environment Minister Tomas Chalupa.CAFES SUBMERGED The Charles Bridge, a favourite spot for tourists that dates to the 14th century, was closed. Tree trunks floated by in the muddy brown water. A riverside path that is below street level, is usually populated with cyclists and people sitting at cafes, was under water on Monday.
""We left England yesterday and it was sunny and warm. We didn't expect this, we don't even have our raincoats,"" said British tourist Alison Tadman, who came to Prague with her husband, Adrian, to celebrate her 47th birthday.She and her husband were sheltering in a McDonald's restaurant. ""We're pretty disappointed,"" she said.

Some of the worst flooding was around the Danube river, which starts in Germany and winds its way through countries including Austria, Slovakia and Hungary on its way to the Black Sea. The river was swollen by heavy rain at the weekend.In Germany, the interior minister flew to flood-hit regions on Monday and Chancellor Angela Merkel was preparing to go on Tuesday, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.How her government responds to the emergency could have some bearing on the outcome of a nationwide election in September.Shipping was stopped on parts of the Danube and Rhine rivers in Germany, and along the entire Austrian stretch of the Danube, because of the high waters. The rivers are important arteries for moving grains, coals and other commodities.

Thousands of people living in low-lying areas in Austria and the Czech Republic had to be evacuated from their homes. In the Austrian town of Schaerding, a duck swam across a road intersection, past the gates of a flooded cemetery.The flooding killed five people in the Czech Republic over the weekend and on Monday the death toll went up to six - a worker electrocuted while trying to switch off a flooded electricity transformer 50 km (30 miles) east of Prague, the Czech news agency CTK reported.In the Austrian city of Salzburg, 160 passengers were put up overnight in army barracks after the floods stranded their train. Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger told reporters the situation in some areas was ""very fraught.""The risk on Monday was that the flood danger could follow the course of the Danube river downstream to other European countries along its route.Workers erected flood barriers along the banks of the Danube where it passes through the Slovak capital, Bratislava, and police shut several roads.""We are getting bad news from Germany and Austria. We have to do all we can to protect ... the capital,"" Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said.In Hungary, whose capital Budapest also sits on the banks of the Danube, state media quoted Gyorgy Bakondi, head of the National Disaster Authority, as saying that 400 people were working on flood defences.He said water levels in the river could reach or even exceed the height seen in the record flooding in 2002.Some climate scientists cited a possible link between extreme weather such as flooding and climate change. The warmer the air, the more moisture it holds. A study last year by a United Nations panel of scientists said heavy rainfalls will become more common in this century. BERLIN ? Raging waters from three rivers have flooded large parts of the southeast German city of Passau following days of heavy rainfall in central Europe.A spokesman for the city's crisis center said Monday that the situation was ""extremely dramatic"" and waters are expected to rise further by midday to their level highest in 70 years.
Herbert Zillinger told The Associated Press that much of the city was inaccessible except by boat and electricity supplies have been shut off as a precaution.At least four people have reportedly died and nine are missing due to floods in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic in recent days."

In Eidsvoll, northeast of Oslo, around 40 homeowners were told to leave their homes because of fears a dam further upslope would burst. Others were evacuated in the counties of Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud and Telemark as officials categorized this year?s spring flooding as the worst since 1995, so far.It may get even worse, with more rain predicted and more rapid melting of snow and ice at higher elevations. Instead of beginning to melt slowly at the end of winter, this year?s unusually cold spring kept the snow and ice frozen well into May. When temperatures suddenly soared last week, the annual run-off quickly turned into the gushing torrents now threatening so many areas that emergency crews were struggling to keep up with demand.

The pumping of flooded cellars quickly became a lower priority on Wednesday as crews worked to prevent more damage by trying to divert the deluge. Roads and major highways were blocked and closed all over southern Norway, with the heavily trafficked E6 highway through Gudbrandsdalen closed in several places. The list of closed roads was so long that radio announcers on Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) referred listeners to the state highway department?s website for the full list that was constantly being updated (external link, in Norwegian: ?Stengt? means closed).

State railway NSB and railroad Jernbaneverket were also facing enormous challenges, with tracks washed out in numerous places or covered by mud- and rockslides. Main train routes through Gudbrandsdalen and Osterdalen that connect Oslo and Trondheim had to be shut down and NSB couldn?t provide alternative bus transport because adjacent roads were blocked as well. The Kongsvinger line to Oslo re-opened, however, providing some good news for commuters Thursday morning, but passengers were warned of delays throughout the day. Several long-distance truck drivers had to spend the night in or around Hamar because of highway closures that trapped them where they were, not least because their vehicles are too large to drive on the narrower secondary roads that were being used for detours. In addition to the evacuations in Eidsvoll and Kvam, around 20 homeowners were ordered to leave their homes in Nesbyen and 43 in Nord-Aurdal.

There were reports they may never be allowed to return and will be forced to rebuild in other areas because of the increased incidence of flooding in recent years. Insurance companies were launching a debate over whether other policy holders should be expected to effectively pay for the losses suffered by those who insisted on rebuilding in areas hit by floods just two years ago.

Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes after heavy rain caused flooding in southeastern Norway. In Nesbyen, a mudslide reached properties, filling some basements with water. A river overflowed its banks in Kvam, sending water through the centre of the village. Around 250 people had to be evacuated. Roads and rail services have also been affected by the bad weather, including the busy E6 highway, which links Oslo to the Mjosa region and northern parts of the country"""

In Burma, there were fears for tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims living in camps in low-lying areas of Rakhine state.They were displaced by ethnic violence last year and many were reluctant to move from the camps.One refugee, Hla Maung, said he had lost his mother and two young daughters during the clashes between Muslims and Buddhists last year, and would not move from the camp.""I lost everything. I don't want to go anywhere. I'll stay here. If I die, I want to die here,"" he said.Burmese Planning Minister Tin Naing Thein said that in all, more than 166,000 people had been relocated.In the event, the storm changed course and appears to have caused only minor damage in Burma.Cyclone Mahasen earlier hit Sri Lanka, causing floods and mudslides that killed at least seven people, according to the country's Disaster Management Centre.At least 50 Rohingya Muslims drowned on Tuesday when boats evacuating them from the path of the cyclone capsized off western Burma. A 1991 cyclone that slammed into Bangladesh from the Bay of Bengal killed an estimated 139,000 people and left millions homeless. In 2008, Myanmar?s southern delta was devastated by Cyclone Nargis, which swept away entire farming villages and killed more than 130,000 people. Both those cyclones were much more powerful than Mahasen, which hit land with maximum wind speeds of about 100 kph (62 mph) and quickly weakened, said Alam, the meteorological official.By the time it hit Chittagong and Cox?s Bazar, wind speeds had plunged to 25 kph (16 mph), Alam said. The storm then dissipated entirely, he said.Bangladesh?s government said at least 10 people were killed by the storm across the nation?s vast coastal region, most either from the collapse of mud walls or hit by fallen trees.Related heavy rains and flooding in Sri Lanka were blamed for eight deaths earlier this week.At least eight people ? and possibly many more ? were killed in Myanmar as they fled the cyclone Monday night, when overcrowded boats carrying more than 100 Rohingya capsized.

Residents have turned to the municipalities and relief agencies for help and healthcare, as sewage mixed with flood water has caused a public health crisis, he said.The Shabelle River flooding has immobilised the town of Beledweyne and inundated dozens of villages, banana plantations and cornfields. Four children have perished in the town, he said.""We have registered traffic accidents and the collapse of fragile buildings as floods terrorise residents who have repeatedly asked for suitable accommodations before this season's tragedy because they knew the dilapidated buildings would not endure,"" Nur told Sabahi.Deqa Nurani Said, a 32-year-old mother of eight in Wanlaweyn, said she took refuge in a public primary school, but hundreds of other residents were sleeping in the open, near the main roads.

Floods also cut off roads, telephone lines and electricity, isolating residential neighbourhoods.Alasow said he saw hundreds of families living in the streets. Life in Jowhar has come to a standstill at many main intersections, he said, and sewage has overflowed because there are no sewers.""The town of Jowhar, which is famous for cultivating rice and vegetables, has gone through some truly harrowing nights due to heavy rains, which have flooded the river,"" he told Sabahi.

This unsettled weather has tended to edge northwards then and south, spreading the rain across a greater area for a time, but essentially it is stuck over the same area. At times there has also been heavy rain affecting Yemen leading to the flooding shown in some these pictures. Rainfall totals have been in the range of 30 to 50mm over a 24 hour period. The heaviest rain reported is 51mm at Qalhat, which lies 170km to the southeast of Muscat. This unusually wet weather is expected to remain across the region for much of this week with signs of drier weather finally returning by Friday."

""But not a cent of that money has come here to protect me and my business from the water.""The 51-year-old pointed in disgust to a water-covered greenhouse. Inside, his pepper plants - in which he has invested about 1,000 euros ($1,300) - lay under waters as placid as a lake's.Submerged orange and lemon groves stand around, while dry pockets that rise above the water here and there are covered in parked cars.A month after heavy rains started, more than 700 houses in the Shkoder district remain surrounded by three feet (about a meter) of floodwater, although their residents stayed on as most buildings are dry inside. About 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land are waterlogged, and rafts or small boats are the only mode of transportation.Obot lies five kilometers (3 miles) from the national road. To cover that distance now takes half an hour by small boat. Most of the houses are two-story constructions, many built in the past two decades by returning immigrants - more than 1 million of whom left the impoverished Balkan country after the fall of Communism in 1990, to seek a better future in the west or neighboring Greece.Their choice of a site may not have been the best. The area has experienced severe floods three times in the past four years, and serves as a basin for surrounding regions.
Pellumb Dani, an official at the Shkoder prefecture, said Thursday that the area is prone to flooding whenever there is heavy rain, particularly as the country's three main hydropower stations that cover 95 percent of domestic electricity needs are built on the nearby Drini River.When it rains a lot, operators are forced to discharge water to lessen the load on dams that could otherwise crack. That goes downstream and floods the surrounding countryside. Dani said the volume of water entering the area in recent days was at times nearly twice as much as can be naturally absorbed or carried away by rivers.But farmers in Obot alleged that power authorities tried to stock up a lot of water in the dams during the summer, and the sheer volume of winter rain took them by surprise, quickly bringing reservoir water to near-dangerous levels.""There has never been flooding in spring,"" 83-year old Pjeter Gjocaj said from a verandah on his water-surrounded house. ""Me and the women have been imprisoned here for a month.""Power company officials weren't immediately available for comment.Authorities have been sending food and drinking water to flood victims, but farmers say their main concern is food for their livestock.""Flooding came at a time when we were to cut the grass (for fodder). Many cows or sheep are on the brink of death,"" said Denard Franja, a farmer who has started a side business as a boatman. ""Authorities have compensated us only for the first floods in 2010. This time they have not come at all.""Regional authorities have promised around 600 tons of fodder imported from Montenegro will arrive in the next few days."

The villagers have temporarily taken up shelter in houses and school buildings in nearby villages that escaped the flooding. ?Musi Banyuasin is the worst hit area. We have declared an emergency flooding situation in the area,? said South Sumatra Social Agency head Apriyadi in Palembang on Wednesday. 

Apriyadi said that the administration had yet to calculate the total financial loss caused by the disaster. 

The social agency, he continued, had distributed 55 tons of rice, 800 boxes of instant noodles, canned fish and clothes. 

?We have also established a number of posts at the border of Musi Banyuasin and Musi Rawas,? Apriyadi added. 

Apriyadi said that this flooding was the worst since the 2007 disaster. The flooding, he said, was caused by non-stop heavy rains and widespread deforestation in the area. 

As of Wednesday, road access to Musi Rawas was still cut off by flooding, said South Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) Yulizar Dinoto. 

Despite the magnitude of flooding, no casualties were reported according to South Sumatra Health Agency head Mat Dani. He said that he had also sent medical teams to take care of flood victims. 

In Legok subdistrict, Telenaipura district, Jambi, the 240 families affected by a flash flood in December requested additional shelter as the four tents that had been provided were simply insufficient. 

Jambi Legislative Council speaker Effendi Hatta, who visited the flood victims on Tuesday, said that he would ask the administration to provide more tents. 

Meanwhile, the remains of two residents of Gitgit village in Bali?s Buleleng regency were found under the debris of a landslide that closed the main road connecting Singaraja and Denpasar on Tuesday night.

Members of the search and rescue team discovered the bodies of Gede Mertada, 35, and Gede Mulyawan Atmaja, 27, underneath mud and other materials on Wednesday morning.

It was reported that the two men, together with other residents of the village, had been working to clear the road of debris from an earlier landslide when another landslide occurred.

I Putu Dana, the head of the Buleleng BPBD, said that the landslides affected a 5-metre stretch of road and had carried heaps of mud, rocks, fallen trees and trash into almost all parts of Gitgit village, which is located on the main Singaraja-Denpasar road.

Gitgit and the neighboring villages near Bedugul resort, an area bordering Tabanan and Buleleng regencies, are very vulnerable to natural disasters because of their geographical and geological positioning. 

The villages are in the hilly areas of Mount Batukaru, surrounded by three major lakes - Beratan, Tamblingan and Buyan - as well as a vast forested area. 

?Almost every year, landslides, flooding, strong winds and other natural disasters occur here, claiming lives, affecting farms and livestock,? explained Dana.

Buleleng is one of the most disaster-prone regencies in Bali, along with Bangli and Karangasem.

Illegal logging, land conversion for farming and the natural topography have contributed to frequent landslides in these areas.
Authorities in the Krasnodar region, which will host the 2014 Winter Games in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, have been under pressure since July floods killed over 170 people in the region, including more than 150 in the town of Krymsk. Locals have complained that that there was no proper early warning system in place to alert the population.
Three Krymsk officials have been detained and suspected of failing to properly warn the residents about the coming floods. But Krasnodar Region Governor Alexander Tkachyov, who faced a barrage of criticism for mishandling the floods, has managed to keep his post.

Vast areas of the state were inundated, forcing thousands of evacuations, destroying homes, isolating communities and devastating farms still struggling to recover from the 2011 floods.

Agricultural organisations warned many farms might not survive.

Six people died in the floods, and search and rescue teams were yesterday still checking for more possible victims in hard-hit areas of North Bundaberg, 400km north of Brisbane.

The floods also ripped away many of the repairs and rebuilding of roads, bridges and other infrastructure carried out since 2011 as well as causing new damage that already appears to be overtaking the cost of the earlier disaster.

State Premier Campbell Newman said the bill had already topped A$2.4 billion ($3 billion) and was still climbing, exceeding the A$2.38 billion impact of 2011.


Insurers estimate the cost of the almost 26,000 claims received so far at A$290 million.

Newman said a permanent fix was needed to protect communities from regular floods and other disasters.

""We can't accept that our communities can be flooded every couple of years,"" he said. ""We can't accept that's how life has to be lived.""

Newman warned the cost would be huge, requiring a wide range of measures including the rethinking of developments, relocating parts of some towns, new levees and more flood mitigation dams.

The full scale of the week's inundation is only now emerging as waters recede and roads reopen, allowing access to areas isolated by floodwaters.

Some areas remain at risk. At Rockhampton, 600km north of Brisbane, the Fitzroy River was expected to peak at 8.5m late last night, below the 2011 peak but likely to affect more than 1000 properties.

Water was rising in some suburbs late yesterday, but authorities were hopeful most homes would escape.

The Condamine River was also still rising, cutting off the Western Downs town of Condamine. The small communities of Toobeah and Bungunya, near Goondawindi on the NSW border, were also isolated.

In Bundaberg, the worst-hit area where about 2000 homes were flooded, some residents were yesterday allowed back to devastated areas of the city's north as waters receded.

Access remained difficult and limited, with roads severely damaged. On one road floodwaters had gouged a 100m-long trench, 2m deep.

Power, water and sewerage had been cut, with no indication of when they would be repaired.

A packed town meeting yesterday was told that 10 properties in the area had been destroyed and about 30 severely damaged.

Bundaberg Council chief executive Peter Byrne said damage was severe, with one home washed onto the road and another missing.

""What I'm saying to you the gravity of the situation is dire,"" he said.

Journalists from Brisbane's Courier Mail, allowed into the stricken suburbs under police escort, described scenes of devastation: homes wrecked, some ripped from their foundations, and cars and trucks trapped in a quagmire of mud.

One weatherboard house had been driven 400m down the street and wrapped around a power pole. All that remained of others were brick remnants. A church had also been destroyed.

Southwest of Bundaberg, the town of Gayndah remained without power.

At Gympie, 160km north of Brisbane, residents and business owners returned yesterday to survey damage after about 150 properties were flooded when the Mary River broke its banks.

The Queensland Farmers' Federation estimated the losses at A$100 million across crops, sugar, cotton, orchards and dairy and pig farms.

Chief executive Dan Galligan warned disaster aid was inadequate and many farmers could not recover, causing severe and prolonged economic impact on communities already battered by natural disasters"

Mozambique authorities on Tuesday considered the evacuation of 50,000 people after heavy rainfall in the flood-struck south, where hundreds died in a major deluge over a decade ago, an UN aid agency said.
The waters have killed 35 people since the start of the rainy season last October ? 13 in January alone ? and eight major rivers are above alert levels.

?The alert level is five metres (16 feet). Yesterday it reached six (metres). If it will go one more metre then it will create a big problem,? said Hanoch Barlevi, local emergency specialist at the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF).
?If this scenario happens, the community that is going to be affected is around 50,000 people,? he told AFP.
The southern Africa nation is experiencing the heaviest rainfall since devastating floods in 2000 killed around 800 people and affected millions.
According to Barlevi, authorities have since developed sophisticated disaster management systems, so a repeat of the tragedy is unlikely.
From Sunday to Monday almost 185 millimetres (over seven inches) of rain poured over the Limpopo river basin in southern province Gaza, where the most vulnerable communities live.
Rains in neighbouring countries also swelled rivers, and authorities opened the sluices from two dams in the south to lower dangerous levels.
Coastal Mozambique is home to nine international river basins, making it especially vulnerable to flooding. Although the rainfall has stopped in most areas, the risk of flooding remains high as waters arrive from further inland.
?Unfortunately there are always consequences from the entire region and not only in Mozambique. The rain stops but the effects come a few days later,? Barlevi explained.
Mozambique?s disaster management teams are set to meet later Tuesday to decide on evacuations.   Beitbridge Bureau ? ZIMBABWE and South African border authorities were yesterday forced to stop both vehicular and human traffic after the bridge at the Beitbridge Border Post was flooded on Sunday night.

The border was only open to travellers after 3am when the waters subsided.

The torrential rains also claimed the lives of three children aged between four and nine years when the houses they were sleeping in collapsed.

Authorities at the border post were forced to stop traffic after the flooded Limpopo River left the New Limpopo Bridge inaccessible.

The bridge links Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The bridge was temporarily closed for three hours at midnight on Sunday.

It was only reopened at around 3am when the water had subsided.

Border authorities from both countries had to harmonise traffic control systems to ensure the safety of motorists.

They also temporarily suspended movement of heavy vehicles over the bridge.

The Old Limpopo Bridge was safe for pedestrians though the situation was under close monitoring by the authorities.

The children's deaths bring to five the number of people who have died in Beitbridge District due to torrential rains that started last week.

Two people drowned, one along Bubi River and another one in a pond in the town.

Forty-two more people were stranded at Chituripasi Village 10, under Chief Elsh Matibe's area.

Their huts were destroyed by heavy rains that hit the area on Saturday and Sunday.

Authorities had also dispatched an Air Force of Zimbabwe helicopter to assist stranded villagers yesterday afternoon.

Beitbridge Civil Protection Unit chairman Mr Simon Muleya said the situation was terrible. Three children were killed in separate incidents when their homes collapsed during heavy rains in Limpopo over the weekend, authorities said.


Vhembe district municipality spokesperson Matodzi Mulaudzi said on Sunday the municipality's disaster management team received the reports about the deaths of two boys and a girl on Sunday morning. 

""A helicopter was sent to a house in Mutele D Village, where it was reported that a girl was killed after a house collapsed on her on Sunday morning,"" said Mulaudzi.

The helicopter was sent after the municipality's disaster management team was unable to gain access to the village in their vehicles because Mutele River was overflowing. Two other children were killed in two separate villages in Malamule.

Police spokesperson Colonel Ronel Otto confirmed the death of two boys who were killed when their homes collapsed in Malamulele on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Leonard Hlathi said three people were killed when lightning struck their houses in Piet Retief during heavy thunderstorms on Saturday morning.

Also in Mpumalanga, an eight-year-old boy was believed to have been swept away in Tonga by the streams and a 67-year-old woman killed after her mud-constructed house fell on her.

'Hardest hit'
""The Tonga area near Komatipoort has been hardest hit by the bad weather in the province with three vehicles having been reported as being swept away by the Nkomazi River,"" said Hlathi. 

These included a traffic department vehicle, with an unconfirmed number of occupants, an ambulance with two paramedics inside, and a private car with two occupants inside. Hlathi said the paramedics were rescued by members of the police water wing.

""Two occupants in the private vehicle were rescued by members of the South African National Defence Force,"" he said.

Other survivors were rescued after they managed to hold on to the trees on the side of the roads until help was found.

KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said some roads had to be closed on Saturday after heavy rains blocked several drainage systems in the northern parts of the province.

""A disaster management team was mobilised and sent to eMpangeni to clear several roads where the water drainage systems were blocked,"" said Mabaso. He said a disaster management team had since been activated and was monitoring the situation.

Assessing the damages
On Friday, 31 houses were flooded at Kanana in the North West, officials said on Sunday. Provincial spokesperson Lesiba Kgwele said a disaster management team was assessing the damages. 

""No other serious crisis were reported including at our borders where we were expecting an influx of visitors from Botswana for the Cup of African,"" said Kgwele."

Hundreds of families have been displaced in the floods, which have occurred during post-New Year festival time. The capital of Nairobi, as well as the Nyanza and North Rift regions, have all been affected.

In the Rift Valley region of Marakwet, where CWS is responding, at least 10 people, including three children, have perished in the landslides.

""Red Cross and Government personnel with assistance from villagers made frantic efforts to look for survivors, some of who were rushed to nearby medical centers for treatment.

It is extremely cold out here and I have counted 165 children and about 335 people totally displaced and living in the open.  They urgently need something to keep themselves warm."" 

Rains are expected to continue through January, officials said.

Anderson Vishalona, a village headman from Chikwawa District, said that floodwaters had already had a severe impact on crops in his area. Farmers who recently applied fertilizer to their maize crops are complaining that the rain waters have washed it off. 

Mafuleka is urging farmers to not apply fertilizers until the heavy rains have subsided and, in the longer term, to opt for crops other than maize that are more resilient. Southern Malawi is prone to seasonal flooding and drought.

Floods could worsen

In Namasalima, a low-lying area of Zomba District, huge tracts of maize fields have been washed away by the floodwaters. Lyness Kasani, 83, is one of about 600 residents in the area whose houses and crops have been damaged. She recalled waking up in the middle of the night to find rainwater cascading down her bedroom wall. ?The floor was flooded with water, and I had to use an umbrella throughout the night as my roof gave up and rain poured inside the house,? she told IRIN. 

In Nsanje, a low-lying area that also experienced heavy flooding in early 2012, resident Gilbert Kaunda described how he saved a young boy about to be swept away by floodwaters. ?He held on to branches, crying, as the waters lifted him up and down till I managed to reach and pull him to safety,? he told IRIN. ?Had I not been there, he would surely have been swept away by the water.?

Nsanje District Commissioner Rodney Simwaka says displaced people in the area are in dire need of food, blankets and tents.

The flooding has so far resulted in three deaths and significant damage to property and crops. Mafuleka told IRIN that her department is carrying out an assessment to determine more accurately the extent of flood-related damage and the needs of those affected. Displacement and damage
The hardest-hit areas are Phalombe, Mangochi, and Nsanje districts, all in the south of the country and in the same region that, only months ago, had been suffering from too little rain. The resulting poor harvests had left nearly 2 million people without enough food to get them through the lean season, according to an October 2012 assessment by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC).
Now, as heavy rains continue, farmers and officials fear the floodwaters will damage crops and worsen hunger.
In Phalombe, thousands of people have been displaced by flooding, and many have evacuated to makeshift shelters in schools and churches. One school alone is sheltering 1,400 people, according to Davi Chibani, assistant district risk management officer, who is on the ground coordinating rescue and relief efforts. Other temporary camps are sheltering hundreds each. 
Chibani says that if the rains do not subside soon, severe crop damage and another year of poor harvests is likely.

The president was pictured standing in water up to his shins ? his trousers rolled up ? at the palace waiting for the arrival of Argentina's leader on a state visit.
The floods were the most widespread to hit Jakarta in recent memory. Authorities said at least four people were killed and 20,000 evacuated. Many more homes were inundated following around five hours of heavy overnight rain that coursed through rivers already swollen by a long monsoon season.
Few areas in the city were spared, from wealthy suburbs to riverside slums and gleaming downtown business blocks. Offices and schools were deserted and traffic ground to a halt. The international airport was operating normally, but travelers were finding it hard to get there.
?This is horrible,? said Yanitha Damayanti, a bank teller stranded downtown. ?For the first time in my life, downtown Jakarta has flooded.?
The city has long been prone to floods, but successive governments have done little to mitigate the threat.
Deforestation in the hills to the south of the city, chaotic planning and the rubbish that clogs the hundreds of rivers and waterways that crisscross the city are some of the factors behind the floods. The city's vulnerability exposes the country's poor infrastructure even as it has posted impressive economic growth in recent years.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the country's foreign minister were pictured standing in water up to their shins at the presidential palace waiting for the arrival of Argentina's President Christina Kirchner, who is on a state visit. The meeting of the two leaders apparently went ahead.

?I have no problem with the palace being flooded, ?Yudhoyono said. ?The most important thing is the people are protected.?

In some places, water levels were up to 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) high. Seen from above, the main road through the heart of the city resembled a muddy river. Even as authorities struggled to rescue those trapped and provide them food and shelter, some were thinking of the economic cost.

?This is an extraordinary disaster,? said Syamsuddin Basri. ?I had to cancel many important business deals.?"""

Colombo (AsiaNews) - At least 503,406 people from 137,019 families have been affected by monsoon floods and landslides in Sri Lanka over the past month. According to data from the Meteorology Department and Disaster Management Centre (DMC), more than 5,370 houses were destroyed while 33,571 were dpartially amaged. So far, the death toll stands at 52 dead and eight missing.

To date the government has set up 71 camps for 7,409 people (1,970 families in total). To help the displaced, the Church, local NGOs and aid associations are distributing dry rations and cooked meals.

The worst affected area is that of the Eastern Province, with 404,930 persons (109,632 families in total) because it is most exposed to torrential rains. 10 refugee camps have been set up there. In the Northern Province, more than 83,080 persons belonging to 23,122 families have been affected by the monsoon. Many of them have found refuge in 12 evacuation centers set up by the government.

According to the DMC, in the coming days flooding could also affect the Central and Southern Provinces.January 10, 2013:""Floods have returned to Sri Lanka after the lapse of a week pushing the death toll to 46 and threatening to return thousands of people who have recently left relief camps, an official said here on Wednesday.Fresh rains in the central part of the country have inundated towns including Nuwara Eliya, which is a popular tourist destination.The heavy rains that began around December 17 2012 gave a short respite in the New Year but have returned bringing with it threats of landslide and flash floods.The Metrological Department has predicted more wet weather in the days to come and warned fishermen against venturing out to sea.""We are monitoring the situation.

The flooding, mudslides and highway blockages due to intense rains spread Sunday to the Peruvian regions of Ancash, Cuzco, Huanuco and Pasco with thousands of people reported to be affected, officials said.Ten kilometers (6.2 miles) of the highway linking the town of Kepashiato with the Valley of the Apurimac and Ene rivers, or VRAE, region are covered with mud and stones from landslides in recent hours, the governor of La Convencion, a province in the Cuzco region, Oscar Rodriguez Monterroso, told Radio Programs del Peru, or RPP.
?There are businessmen and people who are making trips and domestic tourists who are visiting the archaeological sanctuary of Machu Picchu through this zone and who, upon becoming stranded, have had to walk for several hours,? the governor said.

Last year, the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu was affected by the overflowing of the Vilcanota River and had to closed to the public for two months so that the train line leading to it, which had been damaged by flooding, could be repaired.

Officials, however, so far have not said that they are going to have to take measures of this kind at Machu Picchu, which this year will celebrate the 100th year of its discovery.

Fifty towns in Ancash located on the so-called Huaylas and Conchucos routes have been rendered incommunicado by several mudslides that buried the roads this past week, emergency management officials told the El Comercio newspaper.

In Ancash, one of the country?s main tourist attractions, the snow-covered Pastoruri mountain has reduced its schedule for visits by mountaineers to just the morning hours because of the presence later in the day of electrical storms and heavy rain.

Meanwhile, in the region of Huanuco, the overflowing of the Pachitea River has left 550 people affected in the Yuyapichis district, in the province of Puerto Inca, because of the flooding of 110 homes, as well as an unknown number of crop fields.

In the region of Pasco, at least 65 communities in the districts of Puerto Bermudez and Ciudad Constitucion remain under water after the overflowing of the Pichis River, emergency management officials said.

The intense rains have prevented the operation of helicopters in the area to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid, forcing the emergency management office to send some 25 tons of food, clothing, and construction materials by land.

There are 5,000 people affected in Pasco between those who lost their homes and all their possessions and others who suffered more minor damage, but all of them need food and medical attention to prevent the spread of disease, officials said.

The rains will be more intense in the remainder of the month and at the beginning of February, weather service regional chief Ada Ramos told El Comercio."

Besides Corrientes, where on Saturday more than 100 millimeters (3.9 inches) of rain fell in less than three hours, flooding also affected the provinces of Entre Rios, Chaco and Santa Fe.

The flooding has caused the streets, which are submerged, to become filled with trash and dead animals, especially fish and mice, which ? in turn ? has sparked fears that there could be a possible spread of infectious diseases.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) - At least 43 villagers and soldiers drowned in a southern Philippine town Tuesday when torrents of water dumped by a powerful typhoon cascaded down a mountain, engulfing emergency shelters and an army truck, officials said. The deaths raised the toll from one of the strongest storms to hit the country this year to at least 74.Gov. Arturo Uy said rain from Typhoon Bopha accumulated atop a mountain and then burst down on Andap village in New Bataan town in hard-hit Compostela Valley province. The victims included villagers who had fled from their homes to a school and village hall, which were then swamped by the flash flood. An army truck carrying soldiers and villagers was washed away, according to Uy and army officials.""They thought that they were already secure in a safe area, but they didn't know the torrents of water would go their way,"" Uy told DZBB radio.He said the confirmed death toll in the town was likely to rise because several other bodies could not immediately be retrieved from floodwaters strewn with huge logs and debris.Bopha slammed into Davao Oriental province region at dawn, its ferocious winds ripping roofs from homes and its 500-kilometer (310-mile) -wide rain band flooding low-lying farmland.The storm, packing winds of 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 170 kph (106 mph), toppled trees, triggered landslides and sent flash floods surging across the region's mountains and valleys.Two entire provinces lost power and more than 100 domestic flights were canceled. About 60,000 people fled to emergency shelters.Twenty-three people drowned or were pinned by fallen trees or collapsed houses in Davao Oriental province's coastal town of Cateel, which had the most deaths after New Bataan, Davao Oriental Gov. Corazon Malanyaon told the ABS-CBN TV network, citing police reports.Some towns in the province were so battered that no roofs remained on buildings, Malanyaon said.The other deaths included three children who were buried by a wall of mud and boulders that plunged down a mountain in Marapat village, also in Compostela Valley. Their bodies were wrapped in blankets by their grieving relatives and placed on a stage in a basketball court.""The only thing we could do was to save ourselves. It was too late for us to rescue them,"" said Valentin Pabilana, who survived the landslide.In Davao Oriental, a poor agricultural and gold-mining province about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of Manila, an elderly woman was killed when her house was struck by a falling tree, said Benito Ramos, who heads the government's disaster-response agency.The other victims either drowned or were hit by trees, he said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.While some 20 typhoons and storms normally lash the archipelago nation annually, the southern provinces battered by Bopha are unaccustomed to fierce typhoons, which normally hit the northern and central Philippines.A rare storm last December killed more than 1,200 people and left many more homeless and traumatized, including in Cagayan de Oro city, where church bells pealed relentlessly on Tuesday to warn residents to scramble to safety as a major river started to swell.Officials were taking no chances this year, and President Benigno Aquino III appealed on national TV on Monday for people in Bopha's path to move to safety and take storm warnings seriously."

Their deaths brought the toll to four in flooding that has damaged many homes and stores as well as thousands of acres of farmland.One of the hardest hit areas was the Maremma zone of southern Tuscany, where flooding washed out many secondary roads, forced hundreds of people to leave their homes, and isolated several towns.The main A-1 highway was closed in parts of Tuscany, where it runs close to rivers.

Italy hit by rainsPouring rains that occurred in Italy last weekend caused landslides in several cities in the northern and central regions of the country.In some provinces the mud-stream was 1.5 metres deep. The rain destroyed several bridges, caused problems with electricity supply and locked dozens of people inside their own cars.The elements also caused serious damage to agriculture, The Corriere della Sera reports.70% percent of Venice floodedA combination of heavy rains and strong winds has led to a sharp rise in the water level in the Italian city of Venice.As a result of flooding, or ""high water"", as the locals call it, about 70 percent of the city is flooded.The city authorities have announced a state of emergency and have closed schools, other public institutions and travel routes.The city administration is urging citizens not to leave their homes and to remain on the upper floors.
In addition to Venice, other cities on the west coast of northern Italy have been hit by the unusual weather.
In the region of Tuscany emergency services have already evacuated 200 people from dangerous areas.Storms that hit northern and central Italy at the weekend caused huge damage, washing out roads and isolating towns in southern Tuscany.

The severe weather has caused flooding affecting 5,250 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of agricultural land in the state of Andhra Pradesh, according to Vinod Kumar, an official at the state's disaster management department.
Cyclone Nilam roared into India's southeastern coast last week, killing at least 15 people in the state of Tamil Nadu and running a large oil tanker aground on the shore near Chennai.
The storm had already been drenching coastal areas with rain as it loitered over the sea north of Sri Lanka before it made landfall. It brought more than a month's rainfall in just a few of days, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
The ""high impact, long duration"" nature of the downpours ""overwhelmed the rivers and streams"" and led to the disastrous flooding, Cabrera said.
About 70,000 people in Andhra Pradesh, which is north of Tamil Nadu, have been relocated to temporary shelters, Kumar said Tuesday. The flooding has killed 25 people in the state, he said.
The full extent of the damage to crops won't be known until after the flood waters recede, according to authorities.
Tropical cyclones tend to occur in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea during the April-to-June and September-to-November periods.

Superstorm Sandy threatens 'catastrophe' of a lifetime
Tropical Storm Son-Tinh was moving northeast along the northern Vietnamese coast on Monday after tearing the roofs off hundreds of houses and breaching flood defenses overnight, the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.
Son-Tinh was at typhoon level when it thumped into northern Vietnam late Sunday with winds as strong as 133 kilometers per hour (83 mph). It left three people dead and two injured, according to an initial estimate from the Office of the National Search and Rescue Committee reported by (VNA).
More than a 1,300 rescue workers and soldiers have been deployed to work with local authorities on search and rescue efforts in the aftermath of the storm, VNA said.
Helicopters were on standby for a search and rescue mission for an oil rig with 35 people on board that became disconnected from its towboats miles out at sea amid strong waves generated by the storm, according to VNA.
And five people were missing Sunday after winds from Son-Tinh sank an engineering vessel near a cargo terminal in Sanya, a city on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
Son-Tinh is expected to gradually weaken over the course of Monday, regional weather agencies said. At least 260,000 people in Vietnam had been relocated to safer areas as it approached Sunday.
The storm had already killed 27 people when it swept across the central Philippines during the second half of last week, causing flash floods and landslides, according to the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Nine people remain missing, the council said Monday.
East Asia is buffeted for several months a year by heavy storms that roll in from the western Pacific Ocean. In August, a big typhoon, named Bolaven, killed more than 60 people on the Korean peninsula."

Some of the areas hardest hit said this week they did not have the funds in municipal budgets to deal with the damage from the floods, which claimed at least 12 lives.

Some areas received more than 400mm of rain over just a few days, resulting in roads and bridges washing away, houses and buildings being damaged, and many people being displaced.

Eastern Cape education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said seven schools, mostly primary schools, had reported being damaged last weekend. Teaching had however continued this week, since the damage had been mostly partial.

The provincial government has started proceedings to declare the province a disaster area, while some municipalities have already made disaster declarations on a local level.

Shane Brown, acting head of safety and security for Nelson Mandela Bay, which includes Port Elizabeth, said damage estimates of between R300 million and R600m had been received.

Most of the damage was on an infrastructural level, including to roads, bridges and stormwater systems.

He said the mayoral committee had recommended that the area be declared a disaster area, but added that this was also being done on a provincial level.

Assistance had been rendered to more than 4 000 people between the start of the rains last week and yesterday morning. Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Zanoxolo Wayile said earlier this week that ?the impact [of the floods] on the municipal budget will be devastating?.

Ted Pillay, municipal manager of the Cacadu district municipality, said five of the nine local municipalities which fall under its control had been severely affected.

The Ndlambe municipality, which includes Port Alfred, Kenton-on-Sea and Bathurst, had been hardest hit, with major damage to roads and municipal and provincial infrastructure. Severe damage to homes in the poorer areas as well as the more affluent areas had been recorded, and those whose homes were flooded, or in some cases ?flattened?, were being housed in community halls.

The Makana municipality, which includes Grahamstown, was next hardest hit, with the majority of damage done to the road network.

Pillay said some homes had experienced some flooding, but that no one was forced from their homes as a result.

In Kouga, which includes Jeffreys Bay and St Francis Bay, the biggest damage was also done to roads. A bridge in St Francis Bay was washed away, leaving residents cut off. ?

The ATMs are starting to run out of money there, and the petrol stations are running out of fuel,? he said.

In the Sunday?s River and Koukamma municipalities, access roads had been ?terribly affected?, Pillay added. This presented a ?big problem? because these were major agricultural areas.

Huge damage to the N2 near Grahamstown would take months to fix, he said, adding that it was possible the road would need to be realigned, since it would be difficult to fill the damaged portions.

The R72 in the Ndlambe area was damaged in three different places, and repair work was currently under way.

Only light vehicles could use the road, meaning trucks had to take long detours.

In addition, Pillay said, the road closures and damages meant residents were spending more on fuel because some of the detours were ?hundreds of kilometres long?, forcing taxi fares up too.

Ndlambe, Kouga and Sunday?s River had all declared themselves disaster areas, while the Cacadu district municipality had declared disasters in all five municipalities.

Pillay estimated the combined damage for his municipality and the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality could equal or exceed R1bn.

Earlier this week, Eastern Cape MEC for Local Government and Traditional Affairs Mlibo Qoboshiyane said the damage was likely to carry a price tag of more than R1bn, with damage in Nelson Mandela Bay estimated at R600m. Early estimates for Ndlambe and Kouga municipalities released this week were R500m and R97m respectively.

?Local government doesn?t have a budget of this magnitude, and you declare a state of disaster because you need national help,? Pillay said."

Officials in the northern Ontario town of Wawa estimate that damage from a record amount of flooding in the area will run into the tens of millions of dollars.
The town has been under a state of emergency since late Thursday, when heavy rains washed out the area?s main roadways and damaged the local hospital as well as a car dealership, which crumbled into a large sinkhole.
In a statement released Saturday afternoon, town officials said that while the rain stopped some 36 hours ago, ?the runoff continues to cause severe problems? as they go about assessing the extent of the damage.
?Wawa is a large area, and we are now only beginning to understand the depth of the damage due to this flooding,? Wawa Mayor Linda Nowicki said in the statement.
Nowicki said she has asked the province for ?materials and equipment? to help repair local roadways. The mayor has requested that the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing declare Wawa a disaster area so the town may qualify for extra assistance.
The ministry told The Canadian Press that it is reviewing the town?s circumstances and communicating with local officials.
None of the town?s 3,000 residents was injured in the flooding. However, the heavy rains caused a creek to overflow and wash out a large section of Highway 17, which leads into town.
The main road through town, Highway 101, was closed, as was another road that leads to the nearby Michipicoten First Nation, a community of 700 people southwest of Wawa.
""They have no access in or out,"" Nowicki told The Canadian Press.
An evacuation order was issued for the community, and rescue workers spent Saturday airlifting the elderly and those in need of medical care to Wawa.
The rest of the community is expected to be evacuated in the coming days.
Police said Saturday that phone service, including access to 911, remains out in Dubreuilville, Hawk Junction and Missinabie.
While officials assess the damage, they did say that parts of Highway 17 could reopen within days.
The town said in its statement that the southbound portion leading to Sault Ste. Marie could reopen in two days, while northbound lanes to White River may remain closed for at least another week

Likes the neighboring towns of Carlstadt and Moonachie, also located near the Hackensack River, Little Ferry was devastated Oct. 29 when six dirt berms broke from the pressure of a tidal surge. Officials say the water rose five feet in 45 minutes.

Lola Palmerini says she has lived in Little Ferry for nearly 40 years and has never before had water enter her house. But last week the 79-year-old and her husband had to be rescued by the National Guard.

October 29, 2012:""FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (WSVN) -- Crews continue to work on the flooding problems brought on by Hurricane Sandy in Broward County.
Bulldozers are rebuilding the barricades that Sandy's surge knocked down along A1A in Fort Lauderdale, Monday, but residents remain stuck. ""We can't get our cars out, the waves come over the wall, they knock all these dunes down by the time you wake up in the morning, and it takes about four hours for the water to clear, and then it's all sand,"" said Emily Rowe.
Beach front residents have been waking up a whole lot closer to the ocean. ""All of a sudden, sure enough, it's even worse than it was the night before, and we wake up, and it's about a foot higher up our wall,"" said Rowe.
Fortunately, the City of Fort Lauderdale came to the rescue overnight with sandbags for many residents. ""This is ours, this one I made myself, and this is from the city,"" said Isaac Cohens.
Volunteers with the American Red Cross stopped by with sandwiches for those stranded north of Sunrise Boulevard.
On Miami Beach, standing storm surge shut down the Whole Foods on 10th Street between West Avenue and Alton Road. ""In the center of the street in A1A, I mean it was up to about here, and then against the wall on the sidewalk about two to three feet above the sidewalk,"" said Mark Campbell.
Sandy surprised even the most veteran coastal dwellers with her rocky surf. ""Seeing the waves break so far out, I've never seen that before,"" said Rowe.
A coastal flood warning remains in effect for Broward County""        ""The rain and strong winds will continue throughout the day, but the risk of major flooding has subsided for Hampton Roads, according to the National Weather Service.

Water reached about 6.76 feet at high tide this morning at Sewells Point in Norfolk. Forecasters had predicted the crest would be between 6.8 feet and 7.3 feet and that this morning's high tide would be the worst for the duration of the storm. Flooding occurs when the waters reach above 6 feet at Sewells Point.

?The one this morning was the one we had to watch out for,? said National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Orrock.

The next high tide will be about the same ?as the highest high tide you?d normally see in a year,? Orrock said. In other words, expect some minor flooding.

By tomorrow afternoon, when winds will shift out of the southwest and start pushing the water out, boaters and residents in low-lying areas should see a lower than normal low tide, Orrock said. Boaters will need to move their vessels before the 4 p.m. low tide, Orrock said.

Residents in Camden and northern Currituck counties already are seeing the waters recede instead of rise. Three days of strong northerly winds had sucked most of the water out of tidal rivers and creeks, leaving plenty of room for rain runoff      ORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti ?  As Americans braced Sunday for Hurricane Sandy, Haiti was still suffering.
Officials raised the storm-related death toll across the Caribbean to 65, with 51 of those coming in Haiti, which was pelted by three days of constant rains that ended only on Friday.
As the rains stopped and rivers began to recede, authorities were getting a fuller idea of how much damage Sandy brought on Haiti. Bridges collapsed. Banana crops were ruined. Homes were underwater. Officials said the death toll might still rise.
""This is a disaster of major proportions,"" Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe told The Associated Press, adding with a touch of hyperbole, ""The whole south is under water.""
The country's ramshackle housing and denuded hillsides are especially vulnerable to flooding. The bulk of the deaths were in the southern part of the country and the area around Port-au-Prince, the capital, which holds most of the 370,000 Haitians who are still living in flimsy shelters as a result of the devastating 2010 earthquake.
Santos Alexis, mayor of the southern city of Leogane, said Sunday that the rivers were receding and that people were beginning to dry their belongings in the sun.
""Things are back to being a little quiet,"" Alexis said by telephone. ""We have seen the end.""
Sandy also killed 11 in Cuba, where officials said it destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses. Deaths were also reported in Jamaica, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Authorities in the Dominican Republic said the storm destroyed several bridges and isolated at least 130 communities while damaging an estimated 3,500 homes.
Jamaica's emergency management office on Sunday was airlifting supplies to marooned communities in remote areas of four badly impacted parishes.
In the Bahamas, Wolf Seyfert, operations director at local airline Western Air, said the domestic terminal of Grand Bahamas' airport received ""substantial damage"" from Sandy's battering storm surge and would need to be rebuilt.

An easing of the downpour in the central Pennines, turning to a fine mist by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, saved the centre of Leeds and the much-flooded Calder valley town of Hebden Bridge from serious damage. Sandbags were everywhere in Hebden Bridge and pumps on standby, while emergency teams from the Environment Agency in Leeds ran a round-the-clock clearing of drains and watercourses.

The agency warned, however, that further flooding was likely in Yorkshire, the north-west and north Wales overnight before the obstinate centre of low pressure finally crept off the fells and turned its attention to the Midlands and south. The Meteorological Office warned that their turn would be on Wednesday as the weather backtracked down the course it took over the weekend. There are 219 flood warnings in place.

The yo-yo pattern is the result of two weather systems ? a warm front from the Atlantic and a colder one drawn from north of Scotland meeting ? and dumping persistent rain. Although some areas have experienced gusts of up to 70mph, the reluctance of the dismal weather to move off north and east is also due to a weaker jetstream than usual at this time of the year.

The Environment Agency has notified 75,000 properties of the serious risk of flooding since Sunday, but in spite of the failure at Morpeth ? whose recovery was used as a model for Cockermouth when the Cumbrian town was ravaged by floods three years ago ? defences held up well at Ripon, Tadcaster, Dewsbury, Appleby-in-Westmorland and other former trouble spots.

About 200 miles south, in Cooper Landing on the Kenai Peninsula, the Kenai River had yet to crest and the National Weather Service extended a flood warning until Monday afternoon saying that the river will continue rising. Residents of one subdivision were told to be ready to evacuate.
Forecasters said rain would continue falling Sunday, making it tough to predict how high waterways would rise on the peninsula and when they'll crest.
The outlook seemed a bit better in Talkeetna. Rivers and streams draining from the Talkeetna Mountains had crested and water levels fell steadily Friday night, the weather service said. Meteorologists said they don't expect rainfall to significantly increase river levels there, but a flood warning remained in effect for the area as many waterways remained above flood stage.
The Talkeetna River crested at 15.65 feet on Friday, just below the level considered major flooding. It had receded to 12.5 feet by Saturday afternoon, just above the 12-foot flood mark. Only two streets in Talkeetna remained flooded, the Anchorage Daily News reported (http://bit.ly/UDvlWG).
Talkeetna is the last stop for climbers heading to Mount McKinley, North America's tallest mountain. It also has an eclectic population, and has long been purported to be the inspiration for the Alaska town in the TV series, ""Northern Exposure.""
Longtime residents told the Daily News that flooding was the worst they'd seen in more than 30 years. Still, emergency responders said it could've been worse.
""Luckily, we didn't have any buildings float away,"" said Mike Krepel, who runs the Talkeetna Historical Society Museum with his wife, Jenny.
Krepel used a large pump to drain the museum's flooded first floor.
""It blew its way in pretty quick,"" Krepel said. ""We don't think we lost anything important, but we were going pretty hard for several hours.""
Flooding has caused problems over a wide swath of Alaska this week, from Talkeetna to the port town of Seward, 175 miles to the south.
Department of Transportation crews have been working to protect several bridges on the Glenn Highway from fast-moving water. The road is one of two land routes out of populated areas in Anchorage and Wasilla, and the only one in southern Alaska.
The Alaska Railroad was closed through Wednesday as crews repair tracks and bridges, including a 500-foot stretch that was left dangling when the ground beneath it washed out about 35 miles north of Talkeetna.
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened three shelters in recent days, and a fourth was opened Saturday at the state fairgrounds in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage, where evacuees could park recreational vehicles.
Gov. Sean Parnell declared a state disaster Friday for communities hard-hit by recent storms. The declaration covers the Kenai Peninsula Borough, which includes Seward, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which includes Talkeetna, Wasilla and several other towns, the governor's office said.
It was too soon to estimate damage and no injuries have been reported.
""We're just waiting for the next storm to come in, and then we'll start the rodeo all over again,"" said Vickilee Fenster, a spokeswoman for the Mat-Su Borough's Emergency Operations Center"""

Just imagine water that has been trapped, about 10 stories high, breaking a barrier and flowing downwards to Abeokuta. You asked what would happen!""What you would have would be a major disaster Just imagine water 10 stories high rushing downwards. It would wipe out everything on its path. That is what would happen should the Oyan Dam collapse and with the way water is being held back by the authorities of the Ogun/Osun River Basin Development Authority, anything can happen"", he warned.The flood management and control expert pointed out that some of the major reasons dams are built are not being addressed by those who should manage the dams.According to Omigbodun, dams are built for purposes of irrigation and power generation, but these dams are not being used for these purposes and the way water is released 'wholesale' makes the ordinarily bad flooding situation worse for Nigerians.He described a similar scenario happening in the north eastern flank of the country where, he said, waters from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon contribute dangerously to the downward river force of the River Benue.""The waters from the Upper Volta into the River Niger and the waters from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon which rush into the River Benue, with the confluence at Lokoja, all come downwards to the Niger Delta and the states of the S/South zone. Yes the situation in that zone is very terrible but it would get worse because the force of the water is still moving downwards""""WARRI/LAGOS, 10 October 2012 (IRIN) - Some 1.3 million Nigerians have been displaced and 431 have died in what the authorities say is the worst flooding in over 40 years, with 30 of the country?s 36 states affected since July, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).Heavy rain has submerged much of Delta and Bayelsa states in the southwest, affecting some 350 communities and making 120,000 people homeless, according to the state authorities and the Nigerian Red Cross (NRC).Flooding started in Plateau State in central Nigeria in July, spread through Borno, Cross River, Ebonyi, Nassarawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Katsina and Kebbi states in August, hit Taraba Benue, Niger, Kaduna and Kano in September, before affecting Delta and Bayelsa states in September and October.Thousands of people who had sheltered in dozens of temporary displacement sites in Delta and Bayelsa states have had to flee once again as they have been flooded, forcing agencies to build new ones on higher ground. In Bayelsa?s capital, Yenagoa, 3,000 people are sleeping in the Ovom State Sports Complex.Thousands of houses, some 20 health clinics and five hospitals, as well as dozens of schools, churches and government buildings have been destroyed or damaged in Delta State.

More cassava and rice farms went under the water yesterday in the area.Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Mr. Oseloka Obaze, in a memo to the governor said: ?Our greatest fear is that if the flood continues for  a few more days, the entire community will be submerged because the town is almost on a table land. More so, the Omor-Umuerum road which is their only access route is already affected and will soon become impassable.?More than 3,000 flood victims in Delta have been relocated to temporary camps by the Nigerian Red Cross Society, its Secretary, Mr Francis Agarivbie, has said.Agarivbie told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Asaba that the victims were resettled at three camps established by the state government in Asaba, Ashaka and Osisa in the Ndokwa East Local Government Area of the state.He said that the Asaba camp was accommodating more than 2,000 persons, Ashaka 800, while Osisa was providing home for about 500 victims.Agarivbie said that the Asaba camp was becoming too congested, adding it would soon be upgraded to accommodate more victims.He commended the state government for providing relief materials, including blankets, mattresses, standby generators and food for the victims.He appealed to the state government to provide the organisation with more boats and buses, adding that more persons were still trapped in the affected communities.""We still need more boats and buses to urgently evacuate the flood victims who are still trapped in the various communities,"" he said.It would be recalled that the disaster which occurred on Sept. 24 in some communities across the state destroyed residential homes and rendered hundreds of people homeless.The affected communities included Oko-Amakom, Oko-Anala, Oko-Ogbele and Power-line in the Oshimili South Local Government Area of the state.Other communities affected were Aboh, in the Ndokwa East Local Government Area, Benekuku, Ase, Asaba-Ase, and Okpai in Ndokwa East.

It downed power lines and phone lines, as well as disrupted water supplies in some areas in the province.
The central Sichuan city of Suining was hit the hardest, with four reported deaths. Three people were also reported missing. One person was struck by lightning and the others drowned.
The hardest-hit areas include the eight cities and counties of Guangyuan, Mianyang, Deyang, Chengdu, Ziyang, Suining, Nanchong, and Bazhong, according to multiple Chinese-language reports. Three were killed in Shaba Town of Guangyuan City, the Sichuan Online report said.

During the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, more than 68,000 people died. Many of the deaths were blamed on poor infrastructure and shoddily constructed buildings.
Ms. Xu of Shehong told The Epoch Times that the county was quickly submerged in chest-high water. Almost every house she saw was flooded. The water level was reported by Sichuan Online to be as high as about 2 feet on some main roads.
Floods washed away a 20-ton oil storage tank in Dongyue Township in Shehong, resulting in an oil leak. A lightning strike triggered an explosion and an accompanying fire, injuring two people.
A local, who declined to be named, told The Epoch Times that heavy rain inundated the city of Mianyang. It started falling Sept. 10 in the early morning and has not stopped yet.

Despite the use of many pumps and other flood-prevention efforts, floodwater levels rose about 50 centimetres in the economic zones of the province.Officials, as of press time, were still struggling to fill breaks and leaks in the embankment along the Yom River. They initially thought their giant sandbags and gabions would be able to block the water from flowing into the town and causing inundation.
The Provincial Waterworks Authority's Sukhothai branch was flooded and tap-water services to locals were disrupted.
The Yom River also damaged earthen embankments in many other areas of Sukhothai's Sri Samrong and Sawankhalok districts, flooding people living in riverside communities.Schools in seriously flooded areas would be closed down temporarily, officials said.A representative of Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya yesterday visited Sukhothai's Muang district to hand out 500 sets of relief items to flood victims.Deputy Sukhothai Governor Smith Palawatwichai said that during the past week, about 6,000 people in Muang Sukhothai Thani Municipality had been hit by the flooding.In his capacity as head of the Water and Flood Management Committee (WFMC), Science Minister Plodprasob Surassawadee yesterday convened a videoconference with officials and 36 provincial governors.The conference took place after Yingluck received reports that the embankment in Sukhothai had been breached again.""The prime minister is worried about the lives and property of people. So, she has constantly monitored the situation,"" Plodprasob said.He said authorities were taking care of all provinces, not just one particular province.""The government is now fighting not just against natural floods but also against people's fears [about possible flooding],"" Plodprasob lamented.

According to Plodprasob, authorities have mobilised all resources including the latest technologies in tackling the water-related threats. ""The results of our ongoing battle will come out in a month or two,"" he said, adding, ""I believe the situation will not go beyond our control.""

Hydro and Agro Infomatics Institute director Royol Chitdon, who sits on a WFMC subcommittee, said the volume of water in the Yom River in Sukhothai's Sri Satchanalai district had already dropped from 1,500 cubic metres per second to just 1,200 cubic metres. He said the Yom River had overflowed slightly in Sawankhalok district.

""We will be expediting the flow of water into the sea via the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin rivers,"" he said.

On the water situation in Bangkok, Royol said rain would likely continue till today, but would soon ease. ""That means authorities will have time to drain water into the sea before a low-pressure ridge brings more downpours to Bangkok later this month,"" he said.

Thousands of people have been displaced in parts of Kenya's Rift Valley Province as floodwaters continue to submerge houses and schools and destroy crops.

They are among more than 240,000 people throughout eastern Africa are estimated to be affected by seasonal flooding.

An estimated 642 households have been affected by flooding in the Kenyan districts of Baringo and Marigat, with at least five schools being submerged, according to data from the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS).

The floods have caused latrines to overflow, contaminating water sources. ""I have no better water to drink. I have to use what is readily available, even if I am aware of the risk of contracting diseases,"" Lydiah Kuyale, a resident of Loropil Village in Marigat, told IRIN as she fetched flood water for domestic use.

Kuyale's retail kiosk was among those inundated. But even as her family seeks refuge at a neighbour's house, her main worry is her son's education.

""If the classes remain submerged, how will my son get to school?"" she asked. Her son is set to take the final primary school exam later this year.

Chicken farmer John Ledapana is also assessing his losses after most of his poultry were swept away by the floodwaters, leaving him with only six 3-week-old chicks.

Emergency measures

In Marigat District, two rivers that feed Lake Baringo have breached their banks, overflowing into neighbouring villages. Lake Baringo has extended its banks by up to 1.km, according to the KRCS, which warned that a further 290 families are at risk of displacement if the rains continue.

The agency recommended that the river beds be excavated to improve water retention in the rivers and that dams be constructed upstream to control the volume of water reaching the lake.

According to the KRCS, the affected families are in need of emergency food supplies after at least 26 hectares of maize - which had been ready for harvesting - were destroyed. Fodder, beans and water melon crops have also been ruined.

The delivery of relief items such as medicine, blankets, tents and mosquito nets has been hampered by poor road conditions.

Medical supplies and equipment have also been destroyed by floodwaters in some dispensaries, even as affected populations are threatened by waterborne diseases. ""We can only go to the district hospital in Marigat, but it is hard to raise the 400 Kenya shillings (US$ 4.7) transport expenses,"" said a resident.

During a recent visit to a medical camp hosted by KRCS in Ngambo Village, most of the sick children were found to be suffering from diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infections and septic wounds.

""Adults have the same problems but at a lesser number than the children,"" Evelyn Lorgisoi, a volunteer clinical officer, told IRIN.

Mudslides

In the neighbouring Baringo District, another 46 families are living in tents after being displaced by mudslides that struck the Sacho and Kabarnet areas. The mudslides killed two children, ages 12 and 15, and injured seven other people.

The displaced are now seeking refuge in the Kabasis, Kituro, Tartar and Timboiywa areas.

KRCS has identified 407 other families at risk of being affected by mudslides.

About 9 hectares of crops have been destroyed by the mudslides], and some roads have been rendered impassable, said Rift Valley Regional Disaster Management Officer Kennedy Mulama.

""Volunteers are also supporting communities through the dissemination of early warning systems for immediate evacuation of people on noticing signs of mudslides,"" said Mulama."

It?s worrying. There is fear of an outbreak of certain diseases and food insecurity as a result of the heightened rains and flooding,? Ugandan State Minister for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Musa Ecweru told IRIN. 
?Several areas have been cut off. People are uprooting their food crops from the gardens due to fear of them getting rotten. This is going to cause food insecurity and starvation in a few months.? 
Ecweru said that the impassable roads have hindered access to some of the treatment centres for patients suffering from nodding disease in the region.In 1996, as the Ugandan government fought the Lord?s Resistance Army rebellion, almost the entire population of the Acholi region was compelled to move into overcrowded and poorly serviced ?protected villages?.They only began to return to their homes in significant numbers 6 years ago. Since then, many international aid agencies have left or scaled down their presence in the region as the level of emergency humanitarian need declined.?We are working with the ministries of health, works, education, agriculture, water and environment to respond to the situation,? said Ecweru, adding that the government was going to dispatch immediate relief items such as medicines and disinfectant to prevent disease outbreaks.

Neighbouring regions such as Karamoja, Lango and Teso have similarly been affected by the rains, which started in early July and increased in intensity in late August. 

?The situation [in Acholi region] is marked by increasing desperation while more suffering is anticipated,? said Jackson Odong, a research and advocacy officer at the Makerere University, who is based in Acholi.

?The families whose shelters were destroyed currently live in debilitating conditions. Shelter kits containing tarpaulins, buckets, mosquito nets, blankets and tents are a necessity,? he told IRIN.

The floods have also affected the reopening of several schools. 

Augustine Asiire, the Agago resident district commissioner, said other urgent needs included food, utensils, safe water and portable latrines. She named the worst affected areas in her district as Adilang, Kalongo, Lamio, Omot, Paimol, Parabongo and Wol.

The floods are likely to negatively affect several reconstruction programmes in the region such as the National Agricultural Advisory Services, the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund and other projects under northern Uganda's Peace, Recovery and Development Plan, according to a late August rapid assessment by Makerere University's Refugee Law Project.

This assessment warned that perennial flooding in the region could precipitate further conflict. 

?Affected communities have to cope with neighbouring households displaced and searching for shelter, grazing land, food items, land for cultivation and source [s] of livelihood generally,? it said.

?Returning to camps could instigate an increase in land disputes, as vacant land invites encroachment and illegal land grabbing,? the assessment added.

An estimated 50,000 households, comprising about 300,000 people, were affected by flooding in 2007 in northern Uganda.

Tropical Cyclone,Korea, Dem P Rep: Typhoon Bolaven hit the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea on 28 Aug 2012, worsening the extensive flooding caused by successive torrential rains and tropical storms since July. Preliminary information released by the government indicate that as of 3 Sep, at least 59 persons are dead, 5,766 houses have been destroyed or damaged and 2192 houses are submerged. Up to 52,299 hectares of crop land were submerged, buried or washed away, aggravating the food situation in the country..South offers to help flood-hit North Korea

South Korea has proposed sending emergency relief aid to North Korea, the first such offer since relations sank into a deep freeze after the death of the North's leader last December.
The South's Red Cross chief sent a proposal on Monday, calling for talks with North Korea on aid shipment, the Unification Ministry, which handles cross-border affairs, said on Friday.
Official aid from the South to the North often goes through the Red Cross as a matter of formality.

South Korea last sent such aid two years ago, although civilian groups have been allowed to ship aid to the impoverished North despite high cross-border tensions.
.

Pyongyang's state news agency said earlier that floods in June and July left 569 people dead or missing and washed away or inundated 65 280 hectares of cropland.

A strong typhoon which hit the Korean peninsula last Tuesday killed 48 people and damaged at least 50 000ha of farmland in the North, it said on Monday.

North Korea suffers chronic food shortages, with the situation exacerbated by floods, droughts and mismanagement. During a famine in the mid to late-1990s, hundreds of thousands died. win typhoons renewed fears of a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where poor drainage, widespread deforestation and crumbling infrastructure can turn even a routine rainstorm into a catastrophic flood.

Typhoon Bolaven struck the North on Tuesday and Wednesday, submerging houses and roads, ruining thousands of acres of crops and triggering landslides that buried train tracks ? scenes that are all too familiar in this disaster-prone nation. A second major storm, Typhoon Tembin, pounded the Korean Peninsula with more rains Thursday before dissipating.

The storms came with North Korea still recovering from earlier floods that killed more than 170 people and destroyed thousands of homes. That in turn followed a springtime drought that was the worst in a century in some areas.

The disaster relief group AmeriCares announced late Thursday that enough emergency antibiotics and medical supplies to treat 15,000 North Koreans would be airlifted to the country as early as this week in coordination with North Korean officials. Damage to 69 hospitals and clinics suffered during the earlier floods has left 700,000 North Koreans without access to health care at a time when scores are fighting off the threat of infection while living in temporary shelters, the group said in a statement.

Other foreign aid groups said they were standing by in Pyongyang, but had not received new requests for help from the North Korean government. They had little information on the extent of damage and were relying on reports from state media. The country?s wariness toward the outside world, as well as a primitive rural road system, means aid may be slow arriving, if it is allowed to come at all.

?These fresh storms, coming just a few weeks after the serious flooding ? they do raise concerns because we see parts of the countryside battered again that have already been left in a vulnerable state,? said Francis Markus, spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in East Asia.

Tembin?s strong winds and hard rain pounded South Korea on Thursday as residents of some cities waded through streets flooded with murky, knee-deep water. The storm moved off the peninsula?s east coast overnight. The national weather agency in Seoul predicted some cities in southern North Korea could see up to 80 mm (3.15 inches) of rain, but North Korea didn?t immediately release details on rainfall, deaths or damage from the latest storm.

The earlier storm, Bolaven, left 20 people dead or missing in South Korea. It killed three people and left 3,300 people homeless in North Korea, the country?s official media reported."""

Mijinyawa said the flooding came after neighboring Cameroon released water from a dam. Officials say flooding in neighboring Adamawa state, also blamed on the water release from the dam, has killed at least 15 people in recent days.
Nigerian emergency management officials say Cameroon alerted Nigeria before opening the dam.

Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Flooding in Cameroon's Far North Region has killed nearly 30 people and affected more than 26,000 others, officials said Monday.
More than 4,000 people in the Logone and Shari division were displaced, and more than 22,000 people in the region of Maga, Mayo-Danay division, also have been affected.
Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary described the flooding as ""a calamity,"" and he called for urgent action to save lives, livestock and property. Dana FM, a local radio station, said the death toll will grow as bodies are collected and identified. For the past few weeks, there has been no sign of the flood easing.
The floodwaters have submerged areas like Benoue, Faro, Louti and Mayo. Homes, crops and barns have been destroyed and herds of livestock killed. Heavy rainfall that has lasted nearly a month has fractured the Lagdo Dam, causing the Benoe River to flood nearby villages.
Cameroon's government has dispatched a military contingent to the area to help and evacuate victims, and the government of Morocco sent food and other aid Saturday.
Aid agencies like Plan International Cameroon and the United Nations Population Fund are concerned about the potential spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and malaria. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized, and tents have been erected to house victims.
Demian Toh, a Red Cross official, told CNN that food supplies are running low and the tents are inadequate for the tens of thousands of displaced flood victims. Toh said there were serious concerns about malnutrition among women and children.
In 2010, flooding in northern Cameroon triggered an outbreak of cholera that claimed nearly 6,000 lives, according to official estimates.
In neighboring Nigeria, dozens of dead bodies have been found floating in remote areas of Adamawa state. Officials there are blaming Cameroon for not alerting them before excess water was released from the Lagdo Dam.
The disaster is being called the worst flooding in Cameroon in more than 60 years. Opposition party member Paul Ayah Abine said the casualties and the insufficient aid given to the thousands of victims show clearly that the government has a fragile emergency unit that cannot predict and respond quickly to natural disasters.

Hundreds of homes and farmlands were destroyed in floods in Katsina State, while roadways and bridges were submerged in Nasarawa State.

The Adamawa flood affected 36 villages in 13 local government areas and was partly caused by the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon, emergency authorities said.

A local diver said apart from the 15 people who died, as many others were declared missing.

""In Yola we counted three corpses, Numan 2, Demsa 3, Guyuk 4, Michika 2, and the list goes on,"" he said, asking not to be named.

Heavy rains that flooded the Niger River along the northern border of the West African nation of Benin have killed at least four people and destroyed farmland, officials said on Monday.

News of casualties and flood damage in Benin came after authorities in neighbouring Niger announced last week that at least 52 people had been killed and nearly 400,000 displaced by flooding there since mid-July.

It reported that more than 5,000 houses had been destroyed or damaged and 12,030 homes inundated, leaving almost 63,000 people homeless.And the torrential rain persisted into Monday, causing further chaos.""Most areas of the DPRK are expected to suffer big damage from continuous downpour accompanied by thunder and storm,"" KCNA reported Monday, using the abbreviation of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.But the agency hasn't provided an update of damage and deaths resulting from it since Saturday.The destruction of farmland is of particular concern in a country that struggles to feed itself.About 4,800 hectares (11,900 acres) of cropland had been washed away by Saturday, KCNA said, and more than 25,700 hectares submerged.Employees from humanitarian groups that operate inside North Korea describe severe malnourishment on a large scale. A deal earlier this year for the United States to ship food aid to the country fell apart after the regime went ahead with a controversial rocket launch.
The highest numbers of deaths so far from the flooding were reported in areas of South Phyongan province, northeast of the capital, Pyongyang.
The heavy rains Sunday hit Pyongyang, as well as North and South Phyongan provinces. The capital is the richest and most developed part of the country, used as a showcase by the secretive, nuclear-armed regime. The provinces tend to be poorer and have weaker infrastructure.

A CATASTROPHIC flash flood that killed at least 164 people in southern Russia on July 7th may have been exacerbated by badly planned road construction, according to scientists studying satellite images of the disaster.The flood, in which an estimated 50 million cubic metres of water swept through the southern town of Krymsk, was the first significant natural disaster of Russian president Vladimir Putin?s third term.The government?s response has been strongly criticised, with the emergency situations ministry saying last week that residents had not been properly warned of the impending floodwater, despite an alarm system that highlighted the danger at least four hours previously.The main cause of the flood was record rainfall, with at least 221mm of rain in the 24 hours beforehand. However, many Krymsk residents believe a discharge of water from the Neberdzhaisk reservoir, south of the town, could have caused the flood, or at least contributed to its strength.The popular hypothesis is that water was released intentionally from the reservoir to prevent water from overflowing into another nearby town.Lev Denisov, head of the laboratory of remote sensing at the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has another theory which experts say offers a more probable explanation.The flood?s force, he said, was caused by water being channelled through small openings in a raised highway south of the city.Using photographs taken from the International Space Station, his team pieced together the path of the floodwater, which he said built up behind a seven-metre-high road embankment south of the town, as well as a raised railway, by late evening on July 6th.The waters were held back by logjams of debris, which temporarily clogged eight narrow bridge openings.?When the pressure became too high, the debris clogs burst, unleashing this wall of water,? Mr Denisov said.He said the height of the flood water was similar to the height of the highway embankment ? seven metres ? and dismissed the theory that the floods were caused deliberately.He criticised the construction of the highway and railway, however, which he said should have had wider bridge openings to prevent the build-up of floodwater. ?

The Anclote rose from 9 feet (2.7 metres) before Debby's approach to more than 27 feet (8.2 metres) on Tuesday, well above major flood level, Pasco County spokesman Eric Keaton saidWater was ankle-deep to head-high in the evacuation area. Emergency crews had to use boats to reach stranded residents in some areas, and 106 Pasco County homes had been damaged.""The city has always been prepared for a water event, but I think Mother Nature woke us up as to how fast she can operate,"" Keaton said.The storm was piling up coastal waters and pushing them inland, preventing the rainwater from draining out to sea.""

Nearly 20 inches (51 cm) of rain has fallen in two days on Wakulla County, a Gulf Coast county famed for its natural springs. Roads were under water in many parts of the surrounding ""Big Bend"" area where the Florida Panhandle meets the peninsula.

Parts of Interstate 10 were closed between the capital, Tallahassee, and the Atlantic coast city of Jacksonville. The storm left 29,000 people without power across the central and northern parts of the state, emergency managers said.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre said Debby could bring another 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) of rain and possibly tornadoes to north Florida and southeast Georgia in the next two days.

Debby's top winds weakened to 40 miles per hour (65 km per hour), just over the threshold to remain a tropical storm. It was expected to weaken further as the centre moved ashore, but could strengthen back into a tropical storm as it crossed into the Atlantic Ocean, the forecasters said.

The centre of circulation was still in the Gulf of Mexico, about 35 miles (55 km) west-northwest of Cedar Key, Florida. But Debby was a large and ragged storm and most of the thunderstorms and rain were northeast of the centre, already over Florida.

Tropical storm warnings were in effect for much of Florida's Gulf coast and could be extended inland as the storm moves slowly east over the state in the next few days.

Debby spawned twisters that killed a woman, badly injured a child and wrecked homes in central Florida in rural Highlands County on Sunday. Florida's coastal Pinellas County was also hit hard, with flooding in some areas and at least 20 houses with roofs that were partially or fully blown off during a tornado-like storm."

A senior member of the Assam Human Rights Commission, a government body, told Reuters it suspects millions of dollars meant for flood control have been siphoned off by state water department officials in the last five years. The commission has demanded a high-level investigation by the government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who represents Assam in the upper house of parliament, called the floods the worst in recent times and promised $1,800 to each victim's family in compensation. Critics say that much of the money will evaporate.""Corruption is rampant before and after a flood,"" said Arup Misra, a prominent environmental activist in the state and a professor at Assam Engineering College. ""Some officials eagerly wait for floods as they could make money on repairing of embankments and relief distribution.""Over the past 60 years successive governments have built levees along most of the length of the volatile Brahmaputra, which is Assam's main river and is fed by Himalayan snow melt and some of the world's heaviest rainfall. Experts say these embankments are both criminally under-maintained and a discredited form of flood management.Assam is famed as a tea-growing region and rich in oil and timber. It is also home to the Kaziranga National Park that hosts two-thirds of the world's Great One-horned Rhinoceroses.LEVEE BREACH DESTROYS HOMESNearly a decade ago, Hannan Sikdar's father lost his home and farm to floods in Assam. On June 28, the same fate struck Sikdar and his family of 10 when the Brahmaputra burst through a dike and swept away their home and everything they owned in the middle of the night.Assam's population is on the rise, and like millions of others, Sikdar lived in a danger zone right next to the river's mud embankment. Millions of dollars were assigned to keep levees in good shape. But in eight years living there, Sikdar says nobody even came to talk about the risks.""This was the place where we made our home when my father lost his property several years ago,"" said the 30-year-old, looking down at the wreckage of his bamboo and wood house from a new makeshift hut further along the embankment.""We were never told that this embankment could break.""Rajiv Sinha, an expert on river dynamics, said the levees prevent the river from spreading silt in its natural flood plain, causing the river to clog up and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods. Similar embankments downstream in Bangladesh have also been blamed for devastating flooding.""In the last fifty years, two things have happened -- the expenditure on flood control has increased tremendously, and at the same time the damage caused by floods has also increased exponentially,"" said Sinha, who teaches geosciences at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur.Globally, flood management trends are moving away from levee-type measures to natural storage areas such as swamps and wetlands. But Assam has failed to come up with any modern, long-term plan to harness the river.Entire villages, such as the one Sikdar belonged to, have cropped up in flood-prone areas and their only layer of protection is a neglected, crumbling mud wall.As heavy rains continue, officials fear a second spell of floods soon, but victims such as Hanan Sikdar continue to live in tiny straw and tin shelters next to the broad river.""People are living in danger zones out of compulsion,"" said Chandan Talukdar relief worker with Sikdar. ""Till alternative land is found, these people will remain on embankments"" .July 9, 2012:  Assam on Monday reeled under the impact of floods with the Brahmputra and its tributaries playing havoc in 27 districts of the state affecting nearly 24 lakh people and taking the death toll to 124.

Vast tracts of land still remained inundated, official sources said. Besides the 124 people killed in the calamity, 16 others perished in landslides and 17 more were reported missing. Large-scale destruction of infrastructure, cropland and wildlife have been reported from different areas.An estimated 24 lakh people have been affected in the worst-ever flood in recent years, causing large-scale devastation in 4,540 villages with more than 9.35 lakh hectares of land lying inundated.The floodwater has not only submerged 2.55 lakh hectares of cropland but has caused widespread destruction in the world-famous Kaziranga National Park where more than 560 animals, including 14 rhinos, were killed.The situation in the world's largest river island Majuli is also grim with almost the entire island under water.Road services have been affected at 2,847 places while railway tracks, damaged by landslides in the Lumding-Badarpur Railway division, were yet to be restored.""...An estimated five lakh people have taken shelter in 630 relief camps and 150 medical teams have been deployed to provide medical aid while 30 camps have been set up for cattle, sources saidJuly 2, 2012: ""Shillong/New Delhi, July 1 (IANS) Units of the Indian Army have stepped up relief efforts in the northeastern states after swollen rivers caused devastation in the region, leaving over 75,000 people homeless Sunday in Meghalaya alone, an official said.

No deaths were reported, but hundreds of hectares of the maize fields were under water and scores of cattle, goats and chickens had been washed away, he added.The district is prone to floods every year and thousands of villagers defy government orders to move to higher land because they want to grow crops in river banks after the floods, which leave soil rich in silt.

The floods have ravaged most low-lying areas near Mt. Elgon. Not only have homes been damaged, but more than 60 per cent of gardens containing rice, maize, cassava, cotton, sunflower and beans plantations have been destroyed and submerged by floods, officials say. Several animals have been killed and hundreds of residents displaced, as fear of food shortage and hunger looms.The minister of state for disaster preparedness, Mr Musa Echweru said the government estimates that the damage to crops, roads and schools is in billions of shillings.""A number of districts are facing serious problems due to the above normal rains that have washed away bridges, roads and flooded gardens which resulted in food crops rotting,"" Mr Ecweru said.""The affected districts are likely to experience severe food shortage, followed by long dry spell,"" he added.Mr Ecweru's warning comes hardly two months since the government cautioned on torrential rains associated an Elnino, an unusual rainfall pattern accompanied by hailstorm.Section of the community roads that links farmers to various markets within rural Sironko have become impassable after heavy rains hit the district on Wednesday.When Daily Monitor visited the lower parts of Sironko, farmers stood by their flooded gardens in shock and silence as they watched their submerged food crops. ""The government will tomorrow host a special meeting with humanitarian agencies in Kampala to structure a sustainable response to different disasters ravaging the country, a minister said last night.Separately, the Uganda Red Cross Society reported that mudslides and floods - which killed more than 50 people last month alone - have put the lives of 160,240 Ugandans at risk.Up to 32,048 households across the country lack food and shelter, the humanitarian agency's spokesperson Catherine Ntabadde said.She added: ""The assessments indicate the current disasters include hailstorms, floods, landslides, food shortage, population movement and health related emergencies.""With protected water sources destroyed and flooded pit-latrines spewing human waste into water sources, health workers warned of likely outbreak of epidemics such as cholera and dysentery.Bulambuli District in eastern Uganda where twin mudslides killed at least 31 people on Monday is one of the hardest-hit areas. Bridges connecting farmers to markets, pupils to schools and residents to health workers have been swept away by swollen rivers.The rock and mud sludge which rolled down Mount Elgon during the landslides has blocked roads and cut off several villages, complicating accessibility even for relief deliveries. Now Bulambuli leaders say they lack resources and medical workers as demand for health services piles.The district, which Chief Administrative Officer Grace Watuwa said civil servants avoid due to its rough terrain, has only one doctor who juggles his time between the health centres and as the District Health Officer (administrator). There are no medicines here though.Bulambuli DHO, Dr Mpalya Mwiru Gidale, made a desperate plea for more health workers to be posted there and for a replenishing of dried-up medical supplies to cope with the overwhelming work alongside provision of counselling services for survivors.It has a population of 192,000 and is situated on the steepest edge of Mt.

""Relief can never be enough. We will do our best to ensure our own people do not die,"" he said when asked about specific assistance being determined for most needy populations across the country.Mr Ecweru, who earlier told this newspaper that he would use yesterday's weekly Cabinet meeting to pitch for emergency funding, would not detail what government agreed to do.Instead, he revealed that the Food and Agricultural Organisation has released ""a lot of money"" to World Food Programme to stock deliveries for hungry Ugandans.With fears famine might set in as flood waters swamp farmlands, after massive crop failures due to drought, any indecision or delay in official action could exacerbate stress for disaster victims at a time when surging inflation at 21.4 per cent is pushing every citizen a step backwards on the welfare scale"""

Heavy rains in the West African nation destroyed nearly a thousand houses, flooded fields, killed five people and washed away livestock in August.  ?Although there is the need for food and shelter, the situation does not seem to be a crisis,? OCHA said on Wednesday.The rains follow recent concerns about drought which could have led to a poor harvest and food shortages in parts of the country. Last month, the government urged people to pray for rain after erratic rainfall in several parts of Niger.Niger, located in West Africa?s arid Sahel region that runs south of the Sahara desert, depends on rain-fed agriculture for its food needs and has a history of food shortages and nutrition crises. In recent years it has also experienced flooding due to torrential rains""..Collapsed buildings, flooded-out rice paddies: the floods in Niger are not as spectacular as those in Pakistan, but they spell disaster for a people already stricken by a food crisis.Zarmagandaye, Lamorde and Karadje are three districts of the west African country's capital Niamey which have turned into marshland since the beginning of August.Under the ruins of homes built of clay, cats gnaw on the bodies of dead grey lizards, while a handful of children come to splash around in the deserted streets.On Monday, torrential rain brought down the few buildings still left upright three weeks after the Niger river, the third biggest in Africa, burst its banks in the worst recorded floods since 1929.""The bustling districts have now turned into ghost towns, we've never seen the like in living memory,"" Abdou Ganda, an elderly fisherman, said.The United Nations has registered more than 17,000 homeless people in the capital. Only half of them, currently sheltered in schools, have received food, blankets and mosquito nets provided by international organisations.The Niamey-based Niger Basin Authority (ABN), which groups the nine nations crossed by the river and its tributaries, attributes the rise in the river's level to exceptionally heavy rain in neighbouring states such as Mali and Burkina Faso.""We made little of the rising water level and were surprised in our sleep,"" said Mariama, a widow with nine children who lost everything when their home collapsed.According to Niger's Early Warning System (SAP) and catastrophe management officials, the whole of the country, including the perenially arid desert of the northern Agadez region, has been affected by flooding caused by heavy rain.The SAP and UN agencies have estimated that almost 200,000 people have no homes in the eight regions of Niger, where at least seven people have died since the start of the catastrophe, according to media reports.""It's a double catastrophe: before the rain, the people lacked food, now the few reserve stocks of cereal have been washed away by the water. There's nothing left,"" said Ibrahim Mahaman, a village chief cited by the Oxfam aid organisation.More than seven million people in Niger face food shortages in a serious crisis because of a major shortfall in the crop harvest for 2009-2010, according to the UN.In Niamey, while the floodwaters are gradually pulling back, the meteorological office has forecast heavy rain until mid-September."""

The storm, which was a hurricane for days before weakening to tropical storm status earlier Sunday, was blamed for at least 19 deaths across seven states. The U.S. government estimated that the cost from wind damage alone is expected to top $1 billion, with downed power lines leaving more than 4 million people without electricity. ""I want people to understand that this is not over,"" President Barack Obama said Sunday evening from Washington. ""The impacts of this storm will be felt for some time, and the recovery effort will last for weeks or longer."" Some of the biggest, continuing headaches related to flooding, as tidal storm surges and overflowing, fast-moving rivers left homes in North Carolina and points northward awash. Flood warnings and watches were in effect Sunday night for much of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, eastern New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Numerous ""swift-water"" rescue teams were dispatched Sunday night around Vermont, where state emergency management spokesman Mark Bosma said some small towns were ""entirely covered with water"" and people, including a woman who was in labor, were stranded in schools and cars. Vermont State Police Capt. Ray Keefe said that Wilmington is ""cut off,"" hundreds of roads had been closed, and some homes were washed off foundations and into lakes. And ""conditions continue to worsen dramatically"" in Vermont's capital of Montpelier, city manager William Fraser said Sunday night, noting National Weather Service warnings of rising river waters that will cause ""major flooding"" downtown early Monday morning. ""The conditions today have been awful,"" Bosma said. ""Water is pretty much everywhere."" Also hard-hit was New Jersey, where initial fears about coastal flooding -- which had prompted the evacuation of more than 1 million people from the shore -- had given way to fresh concerns about inland flooding. That left many residents like Guy Pascarello, whose family's Secaucus home of 40 years was declared uninhabitable after it became inundated by three-foot-high waters, trying to figure out what to do next. ""I don't know (what we'll do), this is all new ground,"" Pascarello said. ""The good news is that it's just stuff. This is a home and we love our home, but it's just things."" Even locations well inland, like Princeton Junction about halfway between New York City and Princeton, had waters as high as 12 feet that covered roads and bridges, resident Edward Picco said. And streets in downtown Millburn saw major flooding when the Rahway River overflowed early Sunday morning, said Lt. Peter Eakley, the town's deputy emergency management coordinator. ""It's crazy. ... The water is moving between buildings, up, down, all sorts of different directions,"" Rich Graessle told CNN's iReport from Millburn.Along the shore in Long Beach, New York, water poured underneath the boardwalk and into the city's downtown. Outside Philadelphia, meanwhile, waters climbed to street-sign levels in Darby, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said, with the water sending ""couches, furniture, all kinds of stuff floating down the street."" Two buildings collapsed in Philadelphia, Nutter told reporters, but no one was injured. One family paid tribute to the storm by naming their child, born at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Manuel Hurricane Cooper, said Riddle Hospital spokeswoman Bridget Therriault in Media, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia. Those living around the Gilboa Dam in upstate New York, about 50 miles southwest of Albany, were told to evacuate Sunday afternoon due to concerns that the dam could be overwhelmed by ""higher-than-predicted amounts of rain."" Further south in New York City, officials worked Sunday night to return the city to normal. Hours earlier, the Hudson River overflowed in lower Manhattan, receding only after massive amounts of water spilled over jogging paths and into at least one nearby apartment building. Water also lapped over the banks of the city's East River and onto Orchard Beach and Yankee Stadium parking lots in the Bronx. There were no reports of deaths, though firefighters did help evacuate dozens from flooded homes in areas of Staten Island due to neck-deep water, the New York City Fire Department said.Lines on the Metro-North system flooded, eroding tracks and causing significant damage, said Metropolitan Transit Authority chief Jay Walder. But as inspections and clean-up continued, the system -- which was shut down at noon Saturday -- took its first steps to returning with the resumption of some bus services at 4:30 p.m. Sunday. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that the area's three major airports -- Newark Liberty in northern New Jersey and LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy in the New York City boroughs of Queens -- will reopen Monday, two days after they shut down. ""All in all, we are in pretty good shape because of the exhaustive steps, I think, we took to prepare for whatever comes our way,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. It's all due to a storm that first made landfall at 7:30 a.m. Saturday in North Carolina, then paralleled the coast, and slammed into Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey, as a Category 1 hurricane around 5:30 a.m. Sunday, said the National Hurricane Center said.By 8 p.m., Tropical Storm Irene had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and was nearing the U.S.-Canadian border, the center reported. according to the center.One woman is ""feared dead"" in Vermont after being swept away in raging waters in Wilmington, said Bosma. In addition, officials have reported six deaths in North Carolina, four in Virginia, four in Pennsylvania and one each in Connecticut, Maryland and Florida, two in New Jersey.And as the governor of Virginia, parts of which saw 16 inches of rain and top winds clocked at 83 mph, warned Sunday that more bad news may be coming. ""Undoubtedly, there will be more reports of damage, of injuries, perhaps fatalities,"" Gov. Bob McDonnell told reporters. Flanking Obama during his afternoon statement, FEMA director Craig Fugate vowed Sunday that authorities will work with those impacted by the wind, rain, storm surge and resulting flooding. ""When the disaster comes off the news and no one is paying attention, we still don't go home,"" he said. ""We know we've got a lot of work ahead of us."""

Sinha, adding that about 70,000 people were homeless and around 300,500 hectares of mainly rice paddy had been destroyed"" August 25, 2011: ""In Bihar, two and a half days of floods have been turned into a two-and-a-half-month-long affair so that the politics over relief continues, says one of India's leading river researchers.Solutions to tackle the recurring 'man-made' floods lie in a dialogue between the residents of flood-prone plains, the technical fraternity and the government, says Dinesh Kumar Mishra.'They have turned two and a half days of floods into a two and a half months' floods so that the politics over relief continues. Flood is a man-made menace,' Mishra, who was in the city to address a seminar 'Dying Rivers, Living Rivers' at the India International Centre, told IANS.A structural engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur, Mishra has written volumes probing the origin of the Kosi, Bagmati, Mahananda and Bodhi Balan rivers and man-made floods in them caused by breaches in embankments.Currently writing a book about the origin and flow of the Gandak, Mishra's work on the Kosi, 'Trapped! Between the Devil & Deep Waters: The Story on Bihar's Kosi River', remains his seminal investigation.Citing examples from Bihar, which has eight major Himalayan rivers and is ravaged by floods every year, Mishra said that studies reveal that people living in the lowlands of Bihar, on an average, suffer for 20 days in a year.'For the rest of the year, they have a nice, flood-free life. Women do not have to walk for miles with pitchers on their heads for drinking water. There is enough ground water in their courtyard. But no one takes note of that.''If water or floods were the problem, then people could not have lived for centuries in harmony with rivers. But, instead of living with rivers on equal terms, people are now empowering the rivers (in the name of taming it) with the more destructive embankments and big dams,' Mishra said.Any dam or embankments on the rivers should be designed to meet indigenous needs, he said.'In Bihar, residents classify floods into five categories. 'Barh' - in which water spills on the embankment, 'Boah', - when the rivers swamps large areas, 'Humma' - when water half submerges the cattle, 'saah'- when the flood water churns in ripples; and 'pralay' - destruction.'People of the state are used to 'barh' and 'boah'; while the other three are rare,' he said.Probing the dynamics of flood relief politics, he said that earlier, the king used to disburse relief during inundation to 'save his own skin'.'Later, the bureaucrats swindled money for relief. Aid has now been a tool to win elections,' he said.Tracing Bihar's historical relationship with the Kosi, he said those living in the lowlands deify the river by calling it 'maiya (mother)'.In 2008, it however became a terror. A breach in the Kosi embankment in Nepal in 2009 inundated large tracts in adjoining Bihar, affecting more than three million people in 16 districts.'For centuries, the residents have worshipped the rivers. But the outsiders who came there (especially the British) could not adjust to the nature of the Kosi and the Damodar. Hence they became rivers of sorrow because the colonisers and the subsequent government could not collect revenue from it,' Mishra said.'Till 1952, the British rulers and their successors had been creating embankments for commercial purposes so that the river did not come to the villages. That created a need for irrigation and opportunity for revenue. They collected revenue for flood protection too,' he said.An estimate by the Bihar government says the eight rivers of the state have breached their embankments 371 times since 1987.The benefits of embankment are very limited, Mishra argued.'The mud (and later concrete) embankments put the rivers between two walls, prevented them from spilling sediments on its banks and disturbed the water balance with confinement. Tributaries could not join the main rivers. They either flowed parallel to the main river and flowed back to the countryside dissipating into a network of channels demanding construction of sluice gates to control the backflow,' he said.The premise is that the sluice gates will remain open during rainy season, but then they don't function and this traps the tributaries.Offering solutions, Mishra said the natural drainage of the river should not be disturbed as far as possible. 'Rivers are known to flow for benefits; they should not be allowed to stagnate,' he said.(Madhusree Chatterjee can be contacted at madhu.c@ians.in)"".August 22, 2011: "" Floods in Bihar have left nearly 1.5 million people in 12 districts struggling to survive under open skies, according to Special Secretary Sunil Kumar of the Disaster Management Department, even as state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar undertook an aerial survey for the second consecutive day.The department said that flood waters had entered more than 1,000 villages in 500 panchayats and rising level of most rivers threatened to inundate many others.

Rising floodwaters in the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta have broken several dykes in provinces along the upper reaches of the river, especially in An Giang and Dong Thap, inundating thousands of hectares of the autumn-winter rice crop. In An Giang Province, rising waters broke through four dykes in Cho Moi, Tan Thanh and Chau Phu early today and late yesterday, leaving more than 2,720 ha of rice under water. Vo Thanh Phu, chairman of the Chau Phu District People's Committee, said the district had nearly 1,300 ha of rice inundated. In addition, more than 400km of dykes in the district were threatened by floods, he said. Huynh The Nang, deputy chairman of the An Giang People's Committee, said 4,000 ha of rice were inundated in An Giang so far. The Tien and Hau rivers, the two main tributaries of the Mekong, have been rising fast in recent days due to high tides and floods in the upper Mekong.In An Giang Province, the Tien rose to 4.75 metres, 0.25 meter above the third warning level at the Tan Chau Station on Wednesday, while the Hau rose to 4.11 metres, 0.1 metre above the third warning level at Chau Doc Station. In Dong Thap Province, a 30-meter section of the Ca Mui dyke in Tan Hong District's Tan Thanh A Commune was breached on Wednesday, flooding more than 520 ha of rice. Tan Hong People's Committee mobilised thousands of peoples and facilities to reinforce the dyke, but surging floodwaters still overwhelmed the dyke due to its weak foundations. Five other important dykes in Tan Hong that protect more than 3,500 ha of rice are threatened by the floods, according to the district People's Committee. As of Wednesday, more than 1,090 hectares of rice in Kien Giang Province were inundated, with nearly 400 ha destroyed. Kien Giang Province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has provided support of VND9 billion to farmers in Giong Rieng, Tan Hiep, Chau Thanh and Go Quao districts to pump water out of their rice fields. Floods have also eroded several dykes and inundated 815 ha of fruit and other crops in Vinh Long Province's Binh Tan District."" August 19, 2011: ""Kampong Cham. As the floodwaters recede, many living near the Mekong River are returning to their normal lives, even if they know high waters will come againEvacuees are returning to their homes, motorbikes are braving muddy roads and children splash around in what remains of the water, which only days ago inundated homes, roads and cropsBut for others, the flooding has taken human and material tolls that will not disappear as easily as the deluge ? which has killed at least nine people and which experts have called the worst flooding in a decade for this early in the wet season. The burden of such losses weighs heavily on the families of Moha Khnhoung commune, in Kampong Cham?s Koh Sotin districtOne of the victims was two-year-old Phoung Sambath, the only child of a horse-cart driver living in Khpob village. Phoung Nam lost his son on Sunday after he drowned in the floodwaters near the steps of their home. Phoung Nam spoke to the Post on Wednesday, surrounded by neighbours and relatives in a friend?s home that could only be reached by wading through waist-deep water.?I miss my son. I keep imagining past times I spent with him,? said the 31-year-old father, whose wife left the family in April to move to Phnom Penh. ?I lived with my son and now I am alone ? I do not know what the future holds for me,? Phoung Nam said.?When he found out, he cried, he hit the ground, he hugged his son?s body,? relatives of the man told reporters.A modest funeral was held for the child on the same day he died.  Phoung Nam could not afford any new clothing for the child to be buried in, but neighbours pitched in.  Others in the village, which sits on the banks of the Mekong River, suffered property damage and crop loss in the floods which hit the area on Friday and only began to subside on Tuesday.By Wednesday, many of the houses in the village were still surrounded by about a foot of water and some of the roads were impassable. Rice paddies turned to impromptu fishing grounds, as farmers cast their nets into the chest-high water. The Mekong coursed by, high above its banks thanks to heavy rains in Laos and Thailand, forcing the commuter ferry to dock just shy of the village?s main thoroughfare, where residents were counting the cost of the damage. Villager Mao Lalin, 31, may have been lucky compared to some neighbours: the flooding spared his home. But it destroyed the morning glory he grew in the backyard for sale in his village.?I have lost more than a fifth of my income because of the flooding,? he said.?Within the last few years the flooding has never been as bad this,? said village chief Peang Nhen, 61, adding that the boy was the first person to be killed in the village by flooding since 1993. High river water, which inundated around five hectares of rice in the village, also came unseasonably early this year. ?It usually doesn?t begin until September,? Pheang Nhen explained. ?If the rice fields are destroyed, we will have to replant.?Communities across Kampong Cham province are picking up the pieces left by the receding floodwaters. About 25 kilometers away, in the Chirou I commune of Tbong Khmum district, flooding forced the evacuation of 69 families from Prek Toch village alone, said village chief Ly Sarith. Tolas Mab, a 70-year-old resident, said he had been forced to stay with relatives for six days after his home was inundated with floodwaters. ?Villagers who own cattle have evacuated to a safer place ? and some others are living in their boats,? he said, adding that the flooding had caused corn, potato, and cassava plantations in the village to rot.    Villager Hot Soem took his three cows and swam 500 metres to higher ground when the water was at its worst.?Cows can swim so they survived, but 20 of my chickens died,? he said.  ?I could not save them in time.?The 58-year-old farmer spent five days away from home taking care of the cattle.  The rest of his family stayed on in their flooded home to protect their property from theft. ?I am very concerned about their safety because they are not good at swimming,? Hot Soem said. ?Now we are also confronting a food shortage.?The government and NGOs have cooperated to provide ?quick, effective, and relatively organised? support for the thousands of people affected by the flooding, Oxfam spokesperson Francis Perez said on Monday. By Monday, the Cambodian Red Cross delivered 16 tonnes of rice, along with mosquito nets, blankets and other food supplies to villagers in affected areas.   The crisis is abating, at least for now. Mao Hak, deputy general director of the technical department at the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, said yesterday that water levels were stable in Kratie province, and receding in both Stung Treng and Kampong Cham.Still, some villagers continue to take precautions. Num Srey Teang, 28, lives next door to Phoung Nam and was one of a handful of people in attendance at his son?s funeral. Three years ago, she bought her two small children a pair of bright orange lifejackets which they clip on whenever the water from the Mekong spills into the village. ?I don?t always have time to look after them,? she said. ?This area gets flooded every year. August 11, 2011: ""AT least 100 families and about 1,700 cattle have been evacuated to higher ground after flooding from the Mekong Riverinundated areas of Stung Treng and Kratie provinces yesterday.Loy Sophat, Stung Treng provincial governor, said yesterday that rice fields and villages had been flooded in Siem Bok and Sesan districts.?About 100 families have been evacuated to safety and we are providing them with food and medicine,? he said.?The flooding has not yet risen to an alarming level, but the fact that it continues to rain in our province has people worried about their rice fields and crop plantations,? he added.Kratie provincial governor Kham Phoeun reported that a total of 30 communes were flooded in Kratie, Chhlong, Chet Borei and Sambor districts, inundating about 1,000 hectares of transplanted rice seedlings and affecting an estimated 1,000 families.  ?We have evacuated more than 1,700 cows and buffaloes, but have not started evacuating people yet,? he said.Yesterday, Minister of Water Resources Lim Keanhor issued the third statement this week warning those who live along the Mekong to take precautions against flooding caused by heavy rains over the upper Mekong River in Laos and Thailand. Floods may also affect the Tonle Sap and Tonle Bassac rivers."""

Thai authorities tried to stem growing anger among flood victims on Tuesday as water swamped new neighborhoods and the government began mapping out a plan costing billions of dollars to prevent a repeat disaster and secure investor confidence.The floods began in July and have devastated large parts of the central Chao Phraya river basin, killed nearly 400 people and disrupted the lives of more than two million.Inner Bangkok, protected by a network of dikes and sandbag walls, survived peak tides on the weekend and remains mostly dry.But large volumes of water are sliding across the land to the north, east and west of the city, trying to reach the sea and being diverted by the city centre's defenses into new suburbs as they recede in others.In the northeastern city neighborhood of Sam Wa, angry residents demanded the opening of a sluice gate to let water out of their community. Residents jostled with police on Monday and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered that the gate be opened by a meter (three feet).But city authorities warned that the flow through the gate could move via a major canal into large parts of the city which are now dry.""We are opposed to it but the government has ordered the BMA to open the gate, so more water will come,"" said Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) spokesman Jate Sopitpongstorn.""It could reach the Bang Chan industrial estate. We have to see the consequences,"" he told Reuters, adding that residents of the area had been told to be on alert.Yingluck's government and the Bangkok authority represent opposing factions in Thailand's strife-plagued politics.An expert from the government flood management team played down the danger to inner Bangkok of opening the sluice gate, saying the flow was relatively small compared with the amount coming in through leaks in the city's dikes.""Inner Bangkok is not so much an issue,"" said academic Anon Sanitiwong Na Ayutthaya. ""At least we know what to do, it's just a matter of time to fix the leaks.""The disaster has been the first big test for the government of Yingluck, the younger sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.Yingluck, a political novice, took over this year after an election that many Thais hoped would heal divisions that triggered street violence last year.Saving central Bangkok from a ruinous flood would be an important victory. The city's 12 million people account for 41 percent of Thailand's gross domestic product.But prolonged misery in outlying areas and heavily flooded provinces to the north would take the gloss off any victory for Yingluck, especially given a perception that those areas have been sacrificed to save the capital.To the north of Bangkok, Pathum Thani and Ayutthaya provinces have been largely inundated for weeks, along with seven industrial estates that have sprung up over the last two decades on what used to be the central plain's rice fields.""BE PREPARED""People eked out a living in the flooded provinces on Tuesday with women cooking over gas stoves in the shade of plastic sheets strung up over pick-up trucks while men in their underwear cast fishing nets into water covering roads. Cars, trucks and taxis were bumper to bumper for about 20 km (12 miles) on an elevated road out of Bangkok, parked and abandoned safely above the murky tide. The cabinet met to work out a recovery plan that one cabinet minister said this week could cost up to $30 billion, including an overhaul of the water-management system and rehabilitation of industrial estates. Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Kittirat Na Ranong said the government would need to borrow ""hundreds of billions of baht"" to recover and prevent a repeat of disaster during the annual rainy season. ""Any investor, ambassador, I talk to, they never ask how high the floodwaters are but what will Thailand actually do to prevent this from happening again,"" Kittirat told reporters. The government would invite experts from inside and outside the country to help draw up the plan and he would approach the Asian Development Bank to discuss financing. ""We have to be prepared for the future,"" Kittirat said. ""Preparation and the prevention of floods and drought is something we must start to do now."" Yingluck said on Monday she had assured Japanese investors there would be no repeat of the disaster. The government expects it will take three months to get the flooded industrial estates back on their feet. Thailand is the second-largest exporter of computer hard drives and global prices are rising because of a flood-related shortage of major components used in personal computers. Thailand is also Southeast Asia's main auto-parts maker and Japan's Honda Motor Co said car production could be difficult in the second half of its business year ending in March. Its Ayutthaya plant has suspended work indefinitely. The Bank of Thailand has nearly halved its projection of economic growth this year to 2.6 percent from July's 4.1 percent estimate, and said the economy -- Southeast Asia's second largest -- would shrink by 1.9 percent in the December quarter from the previous three months due to the floods. Headline inflation rose to 4.19 percent in October from 4.03 percent the previous month as the flooding pushed up some prices but the central bank said the rises were temporary and it would focus on longer-term factors in setting policy. The floods submerged four million acres (1.6 million ha), an area roughly the size of Kuwait, and destroyed 25 percent of the main rice crop in the world's largest rice exporter. The deluge was caused in part by unusually heavy monsoon rain but the weather has been mostly clear for the past week. The BMA said 2,245 mm (more than seven feet) of rain had fallen this year to the end of October, 40.8 percent above average. ($1=30.75 baht) (Additional reporting by Ploy Ten Kate, Pracha Hariraksapitak, and Martin Petty in Ayutthaya; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)"" October 10, 2011: By Oliver Campbell More than 260 people have been killed by flooding in Thailand since mid-July, and an estimated 2.34 million people have been affected in at least 30 of the country?s 77 provinces.Now the floods, which have mainly hit the northeast, the north and the centre of Thailand, are threatening to engulf Bangkok. The city is particularly vulnerable, because many areas sit less than 2 metres above sea level. Already, pockets of the city have been submerged, with 17 locations flooded over the weekend as a result of heavy rainfall. Flood levels of 30-40 centimetres were reported at one location in the city.The National Disaster Warning Centre warned that nine canals in the capital, already near capacity levels, were likely to break their banks, while 13 districts and eastern zones outside flood barriers were likely to be flooded.High tides beginning this week could exacerbate the flooding, with fears that the Chao Phraya River, which runs through central Bangkok, will break its banks. Authorities are installing up to 400 water pumps along the river and digging canals to divert flood waters.Over the weekend, there were chaotic scenes and frantic evacuations in the ancient city of Ayutthaya, 80 kilometres upriver from Bangkok. The inner city island, where historical sites are located, was inundated after the water broke through the flood walls in many areas. Among those evacuated were some 2,000 patients from the provincial hospital.Residents and rescuers waded through waist- and chest-high water, hopping on trucks and boats, and moving to higher ground with whatever few belongings they could extricate. Journalist Simon Roughneen, reporting from Ayutthaya, wrote: ?All day, groups of people have been clambering onboard dinghies, rafts and impromptu vessels cobbled together from truck tyre tubes, styrofoam boards?anything at all that floats.?Back outside the city?s hospital, Thai Red Cross volunteer Pipath Cheangnoi says he was asked by government officials to help co-ordinate the evacuation of more than 2,000 patients trapped inside the building?an effort that was ongoing as darkness fell amid dangerous conditions with electricity down or unusable, and strong currents swirling in places around the hospital gates.?Roughneen spoke to one relieved mother whose 5-year-old daughter had just been saved by rescuers who pushed through chest-high water to reach her after she was trapped upstairs by an overnight rush of water. ?I was scared, worried. I still am, but thanks to these helpers I have my Sililak safe,? Thanarat ?Yui? Panomai said.The government has discussed possible evacuation measures for Bangkok, but with flood waters bearing down on the city of over 12 million, it is a case of too little, too late. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra told the media: ?We are rushing to drain water and evacuate people before the seawater peaks. We don?t know how much rain will fall when the new storms arrive. We can?t protect every area.?The floods have also destroyed infrastructure, and paralysed economic life in parts of the country. More than 200 roads have been damaged, including the Asian highway, the main route to northern Thailand. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for this year has been scaled down from 4.4 percent to 3.6 percent as a result.Almost 200 factories, including a Honda plant and electronics and car parts facilities, were closed in Ayutthaya, after the Rojana industrial park was inundated. ?It?s a crisis there now,? Industry Minister Wannarat Charnnukul told Bloomberg.com on Saturday. ?There is nothing we can do because the water level is higher than the barriers.?There are fears that the floods, which extend across South East Asia, will further drive up food prices. The Thai farm ministry announced last week that the main rice harvest would be down 12 percent, with over 3 million tonnes possibly damaged by the floods. Thailand is the world?s biggest rice exporter, accounting for around 30 percent of exports.The floods threaten a political crisis for the Puea Thai-led coalition government, which was elected in July following a populist campaign that fraudulently appealed to the aspirations of the rural and urban poor.In a nationally televised address on October 7, Prime Minister Yingluck said: ?We have to admit that this is more serious than in the past? The government is just a little more than a month old and it is difficult to cope with the situation because the volume of water is so high.? Earlier, Yingluck commented that the government was at its ?wits end? because of the flooding.Since taking office, the government has been under pressure from business circles in Thailand and internationally to drop its election promises. Business associations are using the floods to demand that the government drop its pledge to raise the minimum wage. Employer representative Atthayuth Leeyavanija, a member of Thailand?s central wage-setting committee, warned against implementing a promised pay rise, saying: ?Raising wages to 300 baht a day nationwide would have a severe impact on businesses.?Whilst the floods are a natural phenomenon, their devastating impact has been exacerbated by long-term government policies that have subordinated public safety to the profits of loggers and property developers.National Disaster Warning Centre director Captain Somsak Khaosuwan has publicly stated that the severity of the floods was a product of poor logistics and rampant deforestation. The Bangkok Post quoted him saying: ?It used to be villagers had four to five days to prepare, but nowadays flooding can hit the same day as the warning? There are no forests to absorb the water.?Somsak said natural water reservoirs that prevented flooding in the past no longer existed due to building and property development: ?The way we build our roads and urban areas, we don?t consider the natural flow of water. Often we build things directly in its path. Many villages are built right in the path of the water.? He added: ?There are people who believed that their villages would not be flooded because they have never been flooded from the days of their parents and grandparents? But things have changed.?The flood crisis has exacerbated social tensions, with the Bangkok Post reporting violent clashes between residents in wet areas, angry at those living in dry areas. There was a confrontation between farmers and villagers in Ayutthaya province last Friday, with both sides firing shots into the air.Other countries in the region have also been affected by monsoonal rain and tropical storms. More than 170 people have been killed by flooding in Cambodia since early August. Some 230,000 families have been affected by the floods, and another 23,000 evacuated.At least 15 people, including nine children, have died in flooding since late September in Vietnam?s central and southern provinces. Dozens of houses had been swept away in the Mekong Delta and 27,700 more were under water, according to the state-run VnExpress.Two weeks ago, the Philippines were struck by Nalgae and Nesat, which claimed more than 100 lives.Flooding in Henan, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces in China late last month affected some 12.3 million people, killing 17 people, and destroying more than 120,000 houses. The flooding in Shaanxi was reported to be the worst in 50 years.""

About 70 homes were submerged under two metres of water in Ban Thung Sanguan. The tambon has reportedly never flooded before, and the recent flooding was said to have been caused by the diversion of 2,500 cubic metres per second of water from Yom River to Nan River through Khlong Nam Lai to alleviate flooding in Phrae and Sukhothai. Uttaradit Governor Yothin Samutkhiri initially sent officials and 100 relief bags to aid the victims. The damage to Pichai district's farmland has been estimated at Bt22 million.

There were only scattered reports of flooded homes and villages, downed trees and light damage to crops on the southern peninsula, which had been closest to Emily?s core. Alta Jean Baptiste, Haiti?s civil protection director, said the nation had largely escaped Emily?s wrath. After a series of catastrophic floods and mud slides that killed thousands in previous storms, he said residents are paying close heed to warnings and cooperating with evacuation orders. ?The population is understanding more and more the necessity of protecting themselves, before the damages occur,? he said.But fortune also again smiled on Haiti. Just like with Hurricane Tomas last November, the capital city of Port-au-Prince, crowded with some 600,000 people still living in tents 18 months after a devastating earthquake, suffered little damage or flooding.The National Hurricane Center gave the remnants of Emily a good change of reforming sometime this weekend but, aside from potentially heavy rain and strong gusts in the northeastern Bahamas, forecasters did NOT expect the system to pose a significant threat. The system, whether it reorganizes or not, was forecast to move north and eventually curve into the open Atlantic Ocean.Even after it broke apart, Emily swept much of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico with torrential downpours.There were no rainfall reports from Hispaniola but Krizia Negron, a meteorologist in the San Juan office of the National Weather Service, said three to six inches fell across Puerto Rico, with up to 10 inches in spots. More rain likely fell across the Dominican Republic, which caught Emily?s strongest bands, she said.Flooding in rural areas claimed three people there, the newspaper List¡n Diario reported.Two people drowned in Higey, Altagracia province, when they were swept by the Duey River?s current, the newspaper said. Another man drowned in Santo Domingo East while swimming in a drainage ditch.The Emergency Management Center reported 21 provinces remaining on ?red alert?? for flooding. Local television reports showed extensive flooding in rural communities, where plantain farms were under water and many people live precariously near rivers or dams.At a press conference late Thursday, center director Juan Manuel M‚ndez called damage ?extensive.???We ask people not to let their guards down, because precipitation will continue, and the grounds are saturated, especially in the south-southwest part of the country. The rain is what does most damage, not the wind.?In Haiti, damage reports were light.Emmanuelle Schneider, spokeswoman for the United Nations? Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said 235 people were evacuated in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gona‹ves and Miragoane prison. In the Artibonite region, 300 people were evacuated by civil protection teams. Artibonite is an area particularly vulnerable to mass flooding.

The heavy rain affected Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states.Residents of Benin City, Edo State are no strangers to flooding as it is commonplace that heavy rainfall comes with flood. Flood also affected some parts of Taraba State. Flood is our own tsunami or hurricane, though could have been managed without any problem.Flood has only reminded us that the government, be it in Lagos, Ogun or elsewhere, is not addressing the root of our under-development. The recent flood has taught us that sustainable development goes beyond constructing just few roads, bridges and planting flowers on few major roads and go to sleep. In fact, Lagos, like other parts of the country, is moving at a reverse speed. My heart goes out to those who lost their loved ones and also those who lost properties.Different reasons have been adduced to the cause of the damage while some have ignorantly stated that what happened was natural and could not have been otherwise. Governor Babatunde Fashola's response to the flooding is the usual martial order. Fashola had stated that some identified buildings on drainages and refuse dumping in drainages were responsible for the flooding and as such they will be demolished. On the surface, it may look reasonable because there are some houses built on drainages while many have been filled with refuse.However, these reasons are not the root cause of flood, they are just consequences of lack of planning. Where was the same government when these houses were erected on drainages? No one should lose sight of the fact that the flood also affected highbrow areas like Lekki, Victoria Island and Ikoyi.Besides, many of the drainages and canals were not properly built and have overtime degenerated to the extent that they could not properly serve their purposes; most of the canals have been silted and overgrown with plants; drainages have been filled with refuse and sand. Simply, flood could be caused by heavy rainfall that can force the river or ocean to over flow its banks. The recent flood in Lagos was not as a result of overflow of the Atlantic Ocean but by a heavy downpour with inadequate or poor drainage system.Lagos, just like Ibadan and Port Harcourt, is densely populated. The more population increases, the more the challenges of basic infrastructures. Lagos, like other parts of Nigeria, was never planned in a holistic manner. Planning means every area of life is put into consideration when putting and expanding basic infrastructures.When houses were built without putting into consideration a central water system, a central sewage, electricity, drainages, canals, roads, bridges, pipelines, rail lines, dams etc, there is bound to be a problem. In the last 30 years, new areas have been developed in Lagos with no corresponding basic infrastructures, like drainages, roads, canals, etc.Until we recognise that each house or drainage in one street is part of a whole community/city/town there is bound to be disaster. The level of physical development today is largely as a result of self-help or private investment. For example, Mr. A builds his house without considering the environmental impact in terms of what is best for the locality and to others in the community. He is in a race to create a blind alley such as others.A planned society takes into account effective channels of waste water from a building to drainage linking possibly to bigger drainage or floodways and to a canal or dam. And all the drainages, canals, roads etc, must be built to live up to the challenges of a low, high land and the environment in its entirety. When a country leaves everybody to build his or her house, possibly drainages and roads, it is encouraging a state of anarchy!"" July 19, 2011: ""Katsina ? In Katsina state 13 people, mostly children and aged women, have been confirmed dead, while several others were injured following a flood disaster that wrecked havoc in various areas within the state metropolis. According to the state Government assessment committee, three persons including two women sustained fractures, while three others sustained various degrees of injuries as a result of the disaster.Speaking to Weekly Trust on the preliminary investigation of the committee, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works and Housing, Alhaji Danjuma Abdullahi Alti said all the injured persons have been treated free of charge at Government owned hospitals.Weekly Trust investigation revealed that while some of the deceased drowned in a big culvert that passed through various communities within the state metropolis, others were killed by collapsed buildings.Mallam Abdullahi Aliyu an elder in Kofar-Marusa said that ""one of the deceased, Abdullahi Shitu, a JSS 3 student of Government College, Katsina fell into a culvert while trying to rescue a woman who was shouting for help to rescue her two kids.""Late Abdullahi and Al-Amin Rufa'I, a primary four pupil, Weekly Trust gathered were pushed by water to a neighboring quarters called Tudun-Katsira where their corpses was found a day after the disaster.Weekly Trust gathered that over 340 houses have been affected by the flood, while 120 houses completely collapsed and properties worth millions of naira were destroyed. When our correspondent visited the affected areas he observed that the areas were congested and have no drainages for easy passage of water. Quarters such as Kofar-Marusa, 'Yan-Taba, Masanawa, Gafai, Baking, Makuda and Kofar-Yan Daka were in need of roads and drainages to save the residents from the menace of flooding. And even where drainages exist, they were blocked by garbage as the communities are in the habit of dumping their wastes inside them. Weekly Trust also observed that most of the structures affected were constructed on waterways.""""Sokoto ? The Sokoto Rima River Basin Authority recently called on people living downstream Goronyo dam to vacate the areas to avoid being caught in another flood disaster.The villages affected include Kagara Rima, Balla, Boye Kai, Sabon/Tsohon Gari, DanWuru, Dolle and Gidan Magajiya.But some of the residents of these villages insist they would not move. One of such people is Ibrahim Abba of Kagara village who asserted, ""we won't move because they have not given us alternative"".Abba with two wives and 12 children lamented that since last year's flood that left them devastated, nothing was offered them as aid until last week when they were given N9, 000.He stated ""we were left to our plight; no relief material was given to us. It was only last week that they gave us N9, 000 but we have already finished repairing our houses, we would not relocate. The houses government said it was building for flood victims have not even reached one-third completion stage.""Calabar ? Over 500 people have been displaced in Cross River State as a result of the heavy rainfall which lasted four days, while property worth over N100 million were destroyed.Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, Mr. Vincent Aquah, who confirmed this in Calabar, said the persistent rain caused socio-economic damage and destroyed more than 106 hectars of farmland.Aquah said over 40 houses in Calabar and its environs were flooded, leading to the displacement of about 500 people in various parts of the state.The SEMA boss said that based on the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NIMET, predictions for higher rainfall this year, more devastating rainstorms would occur, and may wreck more havoc.He, however, noted that the state government was doing everything possible to ameliorate the sufferings of those affected by the flood.Mr. Aquah said despite the challenges facing SEMA, especially in the area of mobility, the staff were determined to carry out rapid assessment and other intervention measures.He advised the people to urgently contact relevant authorities for rescue whenever there was serious flooding and to vacate such places to avoid loss of lives. ""A heavy downpour that started about 5 a.m. on the early hours of Sunday, 10th July, 2011 in Nigeria and lasted for about 17 hours led to massive flooding mostly of the entire Lagos metropolis, economical capital of country. This led to displacement of people from their homes, serious traffic congestion on roads, destruction of property, and worse, people were reportedly killed in the incidence. Thousands of persons were affected by the floods with many rendered homeless as their houses were submerged by flood water while properties including vehicles were washed due to the intensity of the flood."""

The worst affected villages are Kesukhona, Nepalisuti and Rotua.The situation in Dhemaji was compounded by breaching of a temporary mud dam for diverting water of the Subansiri built during construction of the Lower Subansiri Hydro Electric Power Project.The temporary dam regularly breaches during the rainy season when uprooted trees brought down by the Subansiri fromArunachal hit against it and demolish the bundh, sources added.

Residents, most of them on the south side of the city of 1,141, are being told to get out within 24 hours.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported a levee was breached Sunday morning south of Hamburg in Missouri's Atchison County. The corps' Col. Robert Ruch said crews had been working Saturday on another issue near the breach and all workers were evacuated. The corps declined to release further details.Gen. Derek Hill, head of the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, characterized the breach as a ""boil"" - a leak that ""shoots out like a small geyser"" - that was 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.Iowa sent a Blackhawk helicopter Sunday to drop roughly 1,000-pound sandbags on the levee, Hill said, adding it was too dangerous to use ground crews. It was not known how long the work would take.""It's a technique that's been used before by the corps,"" he said. ""There's no guarantees but we hope it will (work)."" June 5, 2011: ""PIERRE, S.D. ? Flood-threatened neighborhoods of the South Dakota capital and its sister city across the swollen Missouri River largely emptied on Thursday as residents heeded calls to leave for higher ground ahead of the planned release of water from upstream dams. Most of the approximately 3,000 people living in low-lying areas of Pierre and Fort Pierre had left homes, and others loading their belongings onto pickup trucks said they?d be gone by Gov. Dennis Daugaard?s unofficial deadline of 8 p.m. No one was ordered to leave home ahead of Friday?s planned dam releases, but it appeared few were willing to take their chances. Curt Mortenson, 59, said he and his wife moved into a home they built upstream of Fort Pierre just eight months ago. He was born in 1952, the year of the last great flood to swamp the cities, which happened before the construction of dams to prevent future catastrophes. Water releases from the Oahe Dam were expected to increase slightly starting Friday morning and gradually rise until Tuesday, when water levels were projected to crest four feet higher, or about two feet below the levee top. Officials have kept the releases steady for nearly a week as people moved possessions to higher ground, placed sandbags around their homes and arranged for other places to live. A similar release schedule was planned starting Saturday at Gavin?s Point Dam upstream of Dakota Dunes, where the water level is expected to eventually rise another seven feet by June 14, again cresting about two feet below the tops of levees. Daugaard and other officials said emergency earthen levees being built to protect the threatened areas should be completed in time to stop the rising water, but the governor warned people not to assume the levees would hold. ?While we hope the levees will provide protection for property, we urge that people not place themselves in danger or become complacent because a levee that is holding today is just holding today,? Daugaard said. Ed Stutesman of Pierre said it was a sad day Thursday as he finished moving things out of his house. ?When you leave your own place, it?s a different life. Thirty-five years I?ve lived here. Now I?ve got to go live someplace else,? Stutesman said. Daugaard said if the levees hold after the water rises, residents might be able to return to their homes""..May 31, 2011: ""Some South Dakota residents were being told to be ready to leave their homes by Thursday as the Missouri River rose, prompting voluntary evacuations in North Dakota Monday. And, in Montana, emergency workers ferried food and water to a town cut off by flood waters. The measures came as states in the northern Rockies and northern Plains plan for displacement of thousands and scramble to build levees in an expanding fight against river overflows predicted to worsen in coming weeks. The crisis has caused governors in Montana, the Dakotas and Wyoming to call up hundreds of National Guard soldiers to bag sand and try to dissuade anxious property owners from navigating submerged roads and washed-out bridges.

The latest trouble involves a deluge of water that was diverted from the Mississippi River and is headed toward the town of about 12,000 people.The Army Corps of Engineers, desperate to save Baton Rouge and New Orleans from flooding, opened a spigot on a spillway over the weekend, intentionally flooding this part of Cajun country, an area much less populated. But the cascade of water from the Morganza floodway is hampering the local oil industry and fishermen on the bayou.Meanwhile, what is believed to be the first death related to the flooding since the river's rising waters began affecting Mississippi and Louisiana was reported Thursday in Vicksburg, Miss. Walter Cook, 69, who drowned, died early Thursday at a hospital after being pulled from floodwaters Wednesday....Thousands of people were evacuating their homes in Louisiana last night as a massive operation got under way to save the cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge from a flooding catastrophe.

""But we're still going to have problems for the next several days because the water is so high and it will keep the creeks and tributaries high as well.""Downstream, the U.S. government was preparing to open a second Louisiana spillway to ease the flooding threat to New Orleans and Baton Rouge. A spillway near New Orleans was opened on Monday for the first time since 2008.Communities without levees north and south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, already were inundated and residents near the banks of the river eyed their flood protections uneasily.Few injuries have been reported in Tennessee or Mississippi from the flooding, but thousands of residents have been evacuated as the flood tide from snow melt and rains in the upper Midwest has pushed the river miles-wide in many spots.In Shelby County about 500 people were in shelters, and several hundred others were staying with friends and family.""They don't call it the Mighty Mississippi for nothing,"" said Shular, noting that the swollen river is running hard and fast because of the flood. ""We certainly are discouraging people from getting near it and in it.""Shular said many people in kayaks were out in the main channel last night. He noted the dangers of copperheads and water moccasins, both venomous snakes, coming into homes and yards, and that people need to be wary when they return home.Forecasters said weather in Memphis will be sunny and hot over the next couple of days, but thunderstorms were expected on Thursday which could stall the receding waters.Since the Mississippi River flood of 1927 that killed some 1,000 people, improvements have been made in flood control with the building of dams and levees, reservoirs and floodways. Those fortifications have held all along the river this year. Melt from the unusually snowy winter saturated many areas of the Midwest and fed near-record water levels. Problems were compounded in southern Illinois where the rain-swollen Ohio River flowed into the Mississippi from the east.The flooding is hurting farmers. Nearly 3 million acres of farm land in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee are flooded or are expected to flood, officials said.About 500,000 acres of Mississippi Delta farmland were under water, according to Andy Prosser, head of marketing at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce.He said the rising waters were delaying fuel and supply shipments to farmers because some highways were impassable.""This is an issue of supply and demand. There are 11 million cultivated acres of crops in Mississippi and damaged crops will have an affect on prices nationwide,"" he said.Prosser said new plantings under water include corn, soybeans, and cotton with thousands of farmers who have yet to plant wondering when and where they could get a crop in.""We have to watch when the waters recede because that is when the real problems start,"" Prosser said.""I've never seen anything like this and I've been farming for 31 years. This is a once-in-a-lifetime flood,"" said Joe Christian, a 48-year-old second-generation farmer in Jonesboro, Arkansas, about 60 miles northwest of Memphis.The cresting river will be welcome news to the nine floating casinos in Tunica County, Mississippi, about 25 miles south of Memphis. They have been closed because of flooding since May 2, and the economic impact has been severe.Valerie Morris, vice-president for Caesars Entertainment in Tunica, said some of the casinos could open in as early as two weeks, while others could be closed for up to six more weeks.The casinos gross about $87 million a month, with $10 million going to state and local taxes. They also employ 9,700 people. ""This is unprecedented,"" Morris said. ""We're 24/7, so we have never closed.""The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the Bonnet Carre spillway north of New Orleans Monday to divert some water to Lake Pontchartrain. It had no impact on homes or businesses.The Corps also has asked permission to open the Morganza Spillway on Thursday, which would reduce pressure on Baton Rouge and New Orleans by diverting water to the Atchafalaya River Basin. This would force the evacuation of some people and livestock.Last week, the Corps blasted open a Missouri levee, flooding about 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland to ease pressure on the levee system and towns in southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Dozens of farms were flooded.Through Mississippi, residents were bracing for potential record crests at Vicksburg on May 19 and at Natchez on May 21 and authorities were warning that up to 5,000 Mississippi residents may be forced to evacuate."""

He sustained serious injuries on the head and died shortly after arriving at Bombo Hospital where he had been rushed for treatment,"" said Mr Mohamed.Regarding the other deaths, he said most of them occurred when the victims drowned in large pools of water when they tried to cross flooded rivers and streams.""We know that villagers have paths which they traditionally use, as well as other shortcuts... During the dry season they find it easy to cross streams because there is little or no water... they forget that during the rainy season water currents get strong, which is how many people drown in villages,"" he said.Mr Mohamed pleaded with parents in villages to keep a close eye on their children as the latter were especially prone to drowning during the on-going rains.About 3,000 people from more than 100 families in Mbingu Ward, Kilombero District in Morogoro Region have vacated their homes after heavy rains pounded the area for four consecutive days. The houses are now surrounded by floods, and the victims have pleaded for humanitarian assistance, including food and shelter.The deluge has also turned the area into an island, as the road connecting it to Ifakara town, the district headquarters, has been destroyed and rendered impassable.Reporters heading to Mbingu area to witness the situation counted at least 25 vehicles stranded on a muddy stretch near Namwawala Village in Idete Ward. Most of the stuck vehicles were lorries ferrying agricultural produce such as bananas, rice and maize.Mr Charles Mushi, a trader from Mbingu whose hired vehicle is stuck in the mud, told reporters that they have been stranded in the area for four days.""I can't leave because if I do people will steal my cargo,"" he said, adding that the situation was getting worse due to lack of social amenities in the area.He also said that one woman died after a car which was rushing her to hospital got stuck and failed to continue with the journey.

But the controlled resulting flow of water onto farmland has been slower than the Manitoba government had planned.Officials estimate the flood will cover up to 72 square miles (180 square km) of land over the next few days, down from the 90 square miles they had estimated on Saturday. Much of that is rich farmland that usually grows wheat and vegetables.The province had also said that 150 homes could be flooded.""Yes, we've made a lot of progress over the last few days,"" said Steve Ashton, Manitoba's minister of infrastructure.

In 2009, when the Red River flooded at a comparable level, the highway stayed closed for 35 days.The provincial government has set up a detour, but it will add 100 kilometers (62 miles) to a trip from the provincial capital Winnipeg to the United States, said Geoff Sine, manager of the Manitoba Trucking Association.The cost of running trucks the extra distance is about C$1.5 million ($1.54 million) per week for the industry, which wants to see a permanent solution to chronic flood problems, Sine said.The highway is one of the busiest in Manitoba, carrying a total of 1,100 trucks a day.Rail lines owned by Canadian National and Canadian Pacific that run south from Winnipeg into the United States remain in service, spokesmen for the railways said.The main freight carrier in North Dakota, BNSF Railway had four lines out of service due to flooding on Monday, the railway said.All three railways are important carriers of the Red River Valley's crops, which include spring wheat and durum.The Red, which flows north into Manitoba's Lake Winnipeg from North Dakota and Minnesota, is forecast to crest in Winnipeg around the end of April, the same time as the Assiniboine River, another major river that joins the Red.Melting snow on top of saturated ground is causing flooding in Manitoba, with ice jams in rivers adding to the problem.Winnipeg is mostly protected with an engineered floodway that diverts some of the Red's excess water around the city of 633,000 people. Flooding across much of southern Manitoba this year -- taking in a record-large area -- has forced hundreds of people to leave their homes and closed hundreds of municipal and provincial roads.The Red has already crested at most points in the United States.Wet conditions in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are expected to delay farmer planting, which is usually underway by now, by 10 days to three weeks"".."" ?

The current swept him and the vehicle away.Late Tuesday, officials in at least four prairie cities declared states of emergency.Medicine Hat, Alta., is under a state of emergency as officials brace for the possibility a dam break will send melt water surging toward the southern Alberta city.Some 500 homes could be affected if water levels continue to rise in streams in the region, so officials began issuing voluntary evacuation alerts to residents on Tuesday night.The state of emergency was declared at 7 p.m. local time amid predications that the Seven Persons Creek is expected to rise as much as 60 centimetres ""over the next several hours,"" officials said at that time.And in the southwestern Manitoba city of Brandon, a state of emergency was declared to deal with rising water in a southside water retention pond that is expected to breach its banks soon. If it does, Mayor Shari Decter Hirst said 700 homes would be threatened by overland flooding.The state of emergency gives the civic government the right to go onto private property without permission, and do whatever work is necessary to mitigate the effects of flooding. It was required to allow city workers to drain the rising pond into nearby bushland.Meanwhile, officials in Radville, Sask., have declared an emergency after floodwaters rose and threatened homes in one area of the town, plus its water pumping station.Mayor Shirley Cancade said Long Creek began rising over the weekend, then surged Monday evening, approaching several homes in the community about 130 kilometres south of Regina.""We've manage to save one, but another was affected quite dramatically,"" she said late Tuesday afternoon. ""The basement was completely full of water. We had to disconnect the services to the house. It's quite bad, that one.""Also on Tuesday, rising water on the Souris River led the town of Souris, Man., to declare a state of emergency as a precautionary measure in the event the river continued to rise.Stubborn ice on the Souris River drove up water levels to the point where it neared the top of a 36-year-old flood-protection berm, said Charlotte Parham, chief administrative officer for the southwestern Manitoba town located about 250 kilometres west of Winnipeg.Approximately 75 volunteers were erecting sandbag dikes around low-lying properties, she said.""

But the worst of the predictions seems not to have materialized.The area could get up to half an inch of rain Sunday, Schmidt said.The region usually has seasonal flooding after warm weather and rain melts snow in early spring.

Persistent rains in the south of the country have caused floods and landslides, the Civil Protection Department reports that 61 highways were flooded. Meanwhile, the Thai Catholic Church has taken steps to bring aid to affected populations, especially in the southern province of Nakhon Sri Thammarat where ""it rained day and night for several days."" Yesterday, the navy deployed ships and helicopters to recover more than 800 tourists stranded by heavy rains in the southern islands. A further 730 passengers spent the night on board the HTMS Chakri Naruebet, a Royal Navy ship, encamped on makeshift mattresses. The displaced people all come from the island of Koh Tao, while a group of 100 was relocated to other islands, including Koh Phangam. The Ministry of Tourism reports that the foreign tourists, who come mostly from the United States, Australia, France, Britain and Russia are at present in Bangkok and Pattaya. The Catholic Church immediately activated relief operations in the areas most affected by the floods which have damaged several churches and schools. An official of Caritas Thailand told Ucanews that there is an ongoing forum for coordinating efforts in the field. ""We sent a team to the region - said the official - to see what kind of aid is needed and we invited Catholic institutions to support those affected."" BANGKOK ?

National Disaster Prevention Department officials said more than 200,000 people had been affected by the flooding, caused by a high pressure front from China bringing unusually cool and wet weather to central and southern Thailand. Nakhon Si Thammarat province, 610 kilometres south of Bangkok, was the hardest hit by flash floods that began last Friday and were likely to continue for several more days. All flights to the province were cancelled since Saturday after the provincial airport was flooded under a metre of water. Also hit were the neighbouring provinces of Phatthalung, Surat Thani, Trang and Chumphon, where floods blocked roads and inundated farmland. Ferry services to the tourist islands of Koh Samui, Phangan and Tao were suspended as heavy waves of three to four metres hit shipping in the Gulf of Thailand.

Thousands of people and livestock in the Caprivi Strip have had to be evacuated during as annual floodwaters rise in the Zambezi. However, loss of life has been kept to a minimum as informal warning systems prove to be effective.The flooding has affected villages and schools in the rural area. In recent weeks close to 4,000 people have been evacuated to 17 camps situated on higher ground in the Caprivi Region, Namibia's poorest area.The narrow strip of land, barely 30 kilometres wide borders Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is traversed by the Zambezi and some of its major tributaries, the Kwando, the Chobe and the Linyanti.""The Zambezi is stable at around 6.37 metres and the water levels don't seem to be worsening for the moment,"" said chief hydrologist Guido van Langenhove of the Department of Water Affairs in Windhoek.However, in the latest flood bulletin, the hydrologist also noted there were ""very good rains in the very upper parts of the catchment in Angola"" which could mean even higher water levels in several weeks' time.Large areas in the Linyanti and Kabbe constituencies, near the Botswana and Zambian borders are already under water. ""The rainy season is supposed to last several more weeks, so it is possible that it rains again upstream in Zambia. In that case we can expect more flooding, but at least we will know it weeks in advance,"" said Van Langenhove.Local authorities have devised an early warning system that is one of the best functioning in the region. The system relies on informal communication of water levels from country to country by email or telephone.""We have definitely seen an improvement in the speed with which disaster management teams respond. Earlier we would have to mobilise helicopters to airlift people and there was no provision for camps,"" says Van Langenhove.""Because we now can give a warning three weeks before the flood arrives, evacuation points are being prepared on time. Authorities know which people and how many people need to be evacuated, there are enough tents and there is sufficient supply of clean drinking water. Schools get sufficient warning to alert their learners.""Japhet Iitenge Director of Disaster Risk Management in the Office of the Prime Minister, says, ""Together with the forecast of the meteorological office, the warning system that the hydrologists have put in place really enables us to prepare for the floods.""Our preparation started already at the end of last season, with drawing up and revising disaster plans. When we receive the warning that the floods are coming we start implementing them. With the system we are definitely better prepared than before and are able to move people to other villages and temporary camps where they still till the floods subside.""Raphael Mbala, chair of the Caprivi Regional Council, said that in recent days the water has again risen with several centimeters, but casualties so far seem minimal. ""I only know of one fisherman who drowned in one of the villages, otherwise there have been no fatalities.""As the councilor from Kabbe, the most affected constituency, he has overseen the evacuation of an important part of the Region. ""All the people and livestock have been evacuated to higher ground. Some villagers will relocate permanently, but most will return to their homes.""They could face a long wait. ""Sometimes the people can only return to turn homesteads in August,"" said MbalaHe says that the evacuation procedures have been helped by the early warning systems. ""This year for instance we have been successful in moving schools. With the actual school premises being flooded, we have relocated learners and classes continue on higher ground. In my constituency we have relocated four out of six school so far.""For Kabbe alone this means that 720 learners had to be relocatedThe residents of the area are becoming more and more accustomed to the annual floods that disrupt normal life for months.""When I was growing up, floods like this were something that occurred every ten or twenty years,"" says Mbala who is now 63. ""Situations like the one we have now happened in 1961, 1968, 1978 and then in 2003. Since 2003, however, we have had large floods every single year.""Mbala blames the increasing frequency of heavy floods on climatic changes affecting the basin. ""The situation is too much for the government to cope with. We get help from U.N. agencies and the Red Cross, but we still need more blankets, mosquito nets and tents. There is water enough, since we are now basically surrounded by it, but we need more purification tablets to make it safe for consumption."""

On closer inspection, the plants have a sickly yellowish hue and the heads of corn that should be ripening in time for the April harvest are nowhere to be seen. For most of the farmers in this remote, mountainous district, and in many other parts of Lesotho, there will be no harvest this season. Heavy rains which started in December and are expected to continue through much of February have washed away top soil and nutrients and left fields waterlogged and weed infested. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in some of the worst hit districts up to 60 percent of crops have been destroyed while nationally at least 4,700 livestock, mainly sheep and goats, have died. Lesotho?s mountainous topography and erratic weather mean it already produces only enough grain to meet about 30 percent of its needs. The country had increased its production of maize - the main cereal crop - and sorghum during 2010, but the heavy rains are likely to reverse those gains. ?It?s going to affect food security in the worst way because Lesotho doesn?t produce enough food as it is,? Matsiliso Mmojaki, head of the national Disaster Management Authority (DMA), told IRIN. Out of a population of just over two million, Mmojaki estimated 250,000 will need food assistance in the coming months. Not a disaster? In the village of Phaila, in Thaba-Tseka District, Tsepo Phaila, 31, watched one afternoon in early January as a river of water swept down a hillside, tearing up the trees he and his family had planted for firewood, and flooding their maize field. By the time the water receded, only a few broken stalks poked up from the mud. It's going to affect food security in the worst way because Lesotho doesn't produce enough food as it is ""We can't plant there any more because the topsoil has washed away,"" Phaila said. The family has one other smaller field where maize plants are still standing but are too rain-damaged to produce a harvest. ""There's nothing we can do right now,"" said Phaila, explaining that the maize and the firewood provided the only source of income to support himself and nine other family members. Many other households in the village and across northern Lesotho are facing a similar predicament, but the government has yet to declare the situation a disaster. ""Should we say because the government hasn't declared it a disaster, it's not a disaster?"" asked Teboho Chalane, the Ministry of Agriculture's extension officer for Thaba-Tseka District. ""A lot of people have been affected; there will be no maize for them, so we need to do something to make sure they get something to eat."" He added that if seeds could be distributed quickly, there was still time for affected households to grow vegetables before the start of winter. In the longer term, said Chalane, communities needed to become less reliant on maize and start keeping livestock such as poultry and pigs that could be bred and sold. As for the fields of stunted maize plants, his advice to farmers was: ""Take a scythe and cut them all down."" Like many parts of Southern Africa, Lesotho had been warned to expect a heavier than usual rainy season due to the La Ni¤a phenomenon, but Mmojaki of the DMA said ""the intensity [of the rains] was just beyond our imagination; it has never really happened here."" A rapid assessment of the damage conducted in January found that in addition to the extensive crop losses, a number of roads had been washed away making some health facilities unreachable. Stocks of essential medicines, including antiretrovirals (ARVs) and drugs to treat diarrhoea, an outbreak of which had spread across the country, were running low. The DMA has developed a contingency plan and submitted it to the government for approval. It includes urgent repairs to roads, bridges and water supply systems as well as assistance to farmers in the form of subsidies, seeds and fertilizers. The plan comes with a price tag of US$68.5 million, an amount that economic policy head in the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning Motena Ts'olo said the government would struggle to raise at a time when the global economic slowdown and reduced revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were already straining the national budget. ""The rain has created even more pressure and I don't know how we'll manage, but somehow we'll have to,"" she told IRIN.. """

South Africa is reeling from unusually heavy rainfall that has caused flooding in many parts of the country, wiping out crops in what is the continent?s main breadbasket.More than 120 people have been killed in the thunderstorms and flooding since mid-December, and some 20,000 people are in need of assistance. The South African government has declared disaster areas in eight of its nine provinces.And it?s not over yet. Above-average rainfall is forecast for South Africa and neighboring countries for the next few months.Much of southern Africa is now on flood alert, including Mozambique, where at least 13 people have died from floods and thousands have fled their homes for higher ground. Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia are also on alert for flooding.While this is the annual rainy season in southern Africa, the heavier than usual rainfall has been blamed on La Nina, the weather pattern behind the severe flooding in other southern hemisphere countries including Australia, Brazil and the Philippines.In South Africa, the government has put the flood damage at $211 million, but this is an early estimate and expected to rise. At least 13,000 homes have been damaged by the floods across the country, including thousands of shacks washed away, according to the National Disaster Management Center. Squatter communities known as ?informal settlements? have been most affected as they are often built near rivers and in other low-lying areas.The South African government, criticized for being poorly prepared to deal with the heavy rains, announced Thursday that it had stepped up its humanitarian efforts, including increased coordination with local authorities, to help people affected by the floods and to ""minimize loss of lives"" in further flooding.Health authorities are on alert for outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne diseases in South Africa and throughout the region. There are also concerns that the torrential rains will trigger an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, a livestock disease that last year killed 26 people and 8,500 animals in South Africa.Floods have so far cost South African farmers $284 million, including damage to farm infrastructure and lost crops, said the farmers group Agri SA, but a full assessment can only be done once the water recedes. The crops most affected by the flooding are corn, sunflowers and grapes grown to make raisins.Agriculture Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson this week promised government assistance to farmers in the form of replacing infrastructure, seeds and fertilizer, but said there would be no financial compensation.She warned that the floods would result in rising food prices because of supplies being affected.Earlier this month, heavy rains delayed and derailed trains, disrupting exports of coal and corn, said South African logistics firm Transnet.Joe Gondo, president of the National African Farmers? Union of South Africa, said that the system of dams on South Africa?s swollen rivers needs to be improved in the longterm. But for now, all farmers can do is brace for difficult months ahead, he said.?For now, when the rain comes, this is a God-made thing. You can?t stop the rain,? Gondo said.The South African Weather Service on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy rains expected for the next few days in Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West provinces. The country?s biggest dam, the Gariep, is 112 percent full and rising, and the Vaal Dam is at 100 percent capacity.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has appealed to the public to help with donations, saying that many provinces are running out of money to help those affected by the floods.?Without sounding alarmist, I would like to highlight the fact that we are in a race against time to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected,? Dlamini said in a media briefing.Most of the deaths have occurred in the coastal KwaZulu-Natal province, with 88 people recorded killed in the storms and floods, according to a report by Dlamini?s ministry. In the Eastern Cape province, widespread hail storms have damaged property, livestock and crops, and 21 people have died. Lightning strikes and tornados have also caused deaths and property damage.In nearby Mozambique, which has also been battered by torrential rains, the government has issued a ?red alert? for potential floods in the country?s central and southern regions, putting disaster relief workers on standby.In 2000, Mozambique was devastated by widespread flooding that killed 800 people, destroyed infrastructure and caused massive losses to agricultural production.January 26, 2011: ""Flooding in South Africa has killed more than 100 people over the last month, saturating farms in the major food producer for the continent and leading the government to declare 33 municipalities disaster areas.The government at the weekend said the death toll from the flooding had more than doubled from its previous estimate to over 100 people, with most of the fatalities coming from the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province.

Authorities have not given estimates on the number of missing people.Wemerly Moraes, 37, was waiting with his wife outside the morgue on Saturday morning to identify a body that could be the missing two-year-old son of his sister, whose body has already been buried.""This happened on Wednesday morning. When I went there on Thursday, there was still no-one working to find victims,"" the 37-year-old builder said. ""Maybe then he was still alive.""Up to half the victims of the disaster are feared to be children, charity Save the Children said.Gardener Odair da Silva told Globo television that he had to dig out the bodies of his father and stepmother from the wreckage of their home near Nova Friburgo town, where at least 247 people died. He left their corpses on the side of a road ""I asked firefighters for help but they aren't giving much priority to helping people,"" he said.The extent of the damage has posed a challenge for Brazil's new President Dilma Rousseff and exposed major flaws in emergency planning and disaster prevention in a country that aspires to attain developed-nation status in coming years.Rousseff visited the region on Thursday and pledged a swift relief effort that has yet to pan out in some of the hardest-hit areas, though anger has so far been mostly directed at state and local authorities. The federal government has earmarked 780 million reais in emergency aid and donations were starting to pour in from around the country.The torrent of earth and water swept like a tsunami through mostly poor communities, smashing houses and killing whole families as they slept. Some corpses in Teresopolis were found several kilometres away from their houses.Emergency teams are still struggling to reach some areas and have had to dig through the rubble with their hands because vehicles and heavy equipment could not get through. Steady rainfall is further hampering rescuers.Jorge Alfonso, a 42-year-old cook, said he lost 14 relatives when a mudslide virtually wiped out the village of Campo Grande, including his mother, two sisters, a brother and two adult sons. So far, only six of the bodies have been found.""I'm without words,"" said Alfonso, who has been moving back and forth between the cemetery to bury his relatives and the mortuary to identify them ever since the disaster struck.

At least 146 people have been killed in the town, 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Rio.Other officials said the disaster was the worst ever to befall the Serrana, a soaring, lush area that used to be a getaway for 19th-century Brazilian nobility and which is now a tourist spot, especially for Rio residents during the current southern hemisphere summer.In Nova Friburgo, 140 kilometers north of Rio, the number of victims rose to 155, while 34 were killed in Petropolis, according to GloboNews.At least three firemen were killed when they were engulfed in tons of mud as they tried to rescue victims.The death toll could rise in the coming hours, a spokesman for the Teresopolis municipality said. ""There are villages in the interior which we haven't yet reached,"" he said.Officials in Teresopolis said 2,200 people have either lost or had to abandon their homes.The full extent of the devastation remained unknown because communication and access to the stricken zone was complicated by the destruction of roads and bridges, while telephone service was cut in some areas.Authorities say they are particularly concerned over the fate of residents in the Campo Grande area of Teresopolis, where Civil Defence teams estimate 2,000 houses have been destroyed and 150 people buried, according to the G1 de Globo website. Rescue teams were expected to arrive later Thursday.The calamity was the first natural disaster facing Brazil's new president, Dilma Rousseff, who took power less than two weeks ago. She was scheduled to fly over the disaster zone in a helicopter later.At least as much rainwater as the region usually sees in two or three weeks hit the Serrana before dawn on Wednesday, as residents were sleeping in their homes.The downpour triggered mudslides and caused rivers to burst their banks, carrying away cars, homes and people.Meteorologists blamed the extraordinary precipitation on a cold front that intensified the already heavy wet season southeastern Brazil experiences every summer.That cold front moved through Sao Paulo early in the week before moving on to Rio de Janeiro state.More rain was forecast in the coming days.Rousseff's government has released 467 million dollars in emergency aid to help the rain-hit region.The health ministry announced it was also sending seven tonnes of medicine, including antibiotics, blood pressure remedies, masks and syringes -- enough to last 45,000 people for a month.The deadly downpour happened one year after mudslides killed more than 50 people in Angra dos Reis, another tourist area.At least 473 people were killed in Brazil last year as a result of heavy rains, according to the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.""January 9, 2011: ""RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian authorities say the number of people left homeless by flooding has risen to about 100,000 in four southeastern states.

Crews shut sections of Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles and Orange counties to remove loose rocks and clean up mudflow from hillsides. Further inland, rock and mudslides forced the closure of five state routes in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.The rain also washed trash, pesticides and bacteria into waterways, prompting health warnings. Four beaches were closed in Northern California's San Mateo County, and another 12 miles of beach from Laguna Beach to San Clemente in Orange County were off-limits because of sewer overflows.Curtis Duran, 45, and his two children strolled the trash-strewn beach in Long Beach and surveyed debris carried to the shoreline by the Los Angeles River.Cans, baseballs, plastic bottles and even a baby's high chair sat on the sand mixed with piles of discarded wood and shards of plastic.

Of the five affected provinces, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue, Ha Tinh was the worst affected. About 80% of the province's annual rainfall fell in just 10 days. Over half a million people in the province of Ha Tinh, about 70% of the population, were affected in this predominantly agricultural, impoverished area. The central part of the country is not new to the floods, but this year they were particularly serious. The residents, who generally keep their stocks of food in attics, saw them washed away. Others lost their autumn crops, household belongings, tools and seeds for the next planting season.In addition to the infrastructure damage to roads, bridges and canals, 2,000 hectares of paddy fields of the 3000 in the district of Vu Quang were lost, putting people at risk of starvation before the next harvest in May 2011.

It will take supplementary efforts for the next crop season, particularly seeds and fertilizers. Of the region's three crop seasons, the winter spring season which goes from November to April, was the most important, accounting for about 70% of total annual production.Rice, maize, sweet potatoes, beans and peanut crops are at risk unless more aid is forthcoming.

The worst floods in decades from an overflow of the River Chari have the government, NGOs and residents hammering out plans to avoid such disasters in future. Water is still rising from late September when the Chari burst its banks and swallowed up homes in riverbank communities. Residents and experts say similar overflows happened in 1988 and in 1998, but that this flooding is the worst. The government has said it plans to relocate riverbank communities. Some residents - still putting up sandbags and chunks of their broken homes to block the water - want solutions that will allow them to stay put. But that is not viable, Chad Communications Minister Kalzeub‚ Payimi Deubet told IRIN. ""Relocation is the soundest option. Otherwise these communities would see the same destruction again and again. It is a danger for all of N'djamena if we don't stabilize that area."" After the recent overflow, the water rose so that it began to reach higher parts of N'djamena via canals. ""You had a situation where experts observed the flow reversed - instead of water from the city feeding the river, the river started pushing into the city,"" UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative Marzio Babille told IRIN. In a 25 October visit to the neighbourhood of Walia in the south of the capital, President Idriss Deby said the government would set up a higher, dryer area where residents would relocate. ""These populations must abandon the riverbeds of the Chari and Logone rivers,"" Deby said. Logone also flows through the capital and into Lake Chad. Some residents are too attached to their land and prefer to stay, Ngolfou Pierre, head of a Walia neighbourhood flood-response committee, told IRIN. ""We will analyse different options for keeping people here, such as building dykes, and present these to the government. ""We appreciate the president coming here to see the situation first-hand, and his wanting to seek solutions. It was clear that he was moved by seeing this population living in water. We have to look at both options - staying or going. But such a decision must not be made based on emotion but on a solid analysis."" UNICEF is bringing in hydraulic engineers and floodgate specialists from Sweden, France and Egypt in the coming days, according to Babille. ""A sound, quick response to the emergency is preventing the spread of disease and saving lives,"" he told IRIN. ""But at the same time you must have solid mid- and long-term planning to manage the river, use pumping stations, construct effective drainage systems and provide proper sanitation."" An inter-agency (UN and NGOs) group is exploring medium- and long-term solutions for the communities bound to be hit repeatedly by flooding. It is calling for lasting solutions, ""because the rise of the Chari and the Logone is a cyclical phenomenon"", according to a report on a 22 October mission to the area. The group recommends the construction of canals and dykes to protect the riverbanks, the relocation of people living in flood-prone areas and a ban on further construction there."

""It was pain in addition to the pain of losing the crop.""Flood waters that rushed through his home in rural Jigawa state now cover about 34 square miles (55 square kilometers) of farmland there. As the bright sun begins to slowly dry the fields, all the farmers have are ruined stalks and dying plants -- the latest strain on food in a region where other nearby countries face serious shortages.The floods have come at the worst possible time -- just before harvest -- when it is too late for farmers to replant their fields of millet, sorghum and cowpea, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.In northern Nigeria, unusually heavy seasonal rains sent water surging through overflowing rivers. A dam failed in the northern state of Sokoto, flooding out rural pasturelands there and killing about 40 people, according to local media reports.In Jigawa, local officials blame the inundation on officials opening two dams at reservoirs in neighboring Kano state. Typically, the water released yearly from the dams flows into farm fields across the region known as the Sahel, a band of semi-arid land stretching across Africa south of the Sahara. The waters irrigated the crops of Jigawa, a state home to more than 4 million people.This time, a huge wave of water from the reservoirs raced through already saturated stream and creek beds, quickly topping over Jigawa state's simple earthen levees, said Umar Kyari, a spokesman for Gov. Sule Lamido.About 2 million people -- about half of the state's population -- have been displaced or affected by the flooding that began two weeks ago, he said.The village of Gudinchin -- home to a few hundred people once surrounded by fields of tomatoes, corn, rice and millet -- is now cut off from the rest of Jigawa, an island in the midst of murky, fast-moving water ripe with unprocessed sewage. Besides swimming, the only way across comes from two, low-riding wooden canoes donated by the government.There, the dirt-walled granary quickly became a pile of muddy debris when the waters rushed in one night. Villagers used its walls to build an earthen levee against the rushing water. The millet able to be eaten can now be lifted up in only two handfuls.Garba Gudinchin, 55, said he and others live in fear that their dam won't hold long enough to allow the sun to burn away the remaining water. But beyond that, nearly all the village's crops now sit in ruin.""I cannot tell you the figure because it is big,"" he said in the local Hausa language.Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, relies on the crop from its northern states to feed the mouths of those in its oil-rich and commerce-driven south.Kyari, the governor's spokesman, warned the loss of crops would drive up food prices in the country, where most earn less than $1 a day. Kyari also estimates state ranchers lost millions of dollars worth of cattle in the flooding.The nation's farmers also supply other West African nations with their crops, countries already facing droughts and food shortages.In neighboring Niger, international aid experts warn the country faces the worst hunger crisis in its history following a prolonged drought and poor growing season last year. One of the poorest countries in Africa, Niger now has more than 7 million people -- almost 50 percent of the population -- suffering from a lack of food, officials say.Gautam Chatterjee, head of mission in Nigeria for Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors without Borders, said the flooding could affect the region for the next two to three months.""In the longer term, this means an increase in food insecurity and an increase in malnutrition, especially for children under 5,"" Chatterjee said.For now, villagers in Gudinchin who lost their homes, like Mohammed Auwal, live with their neighbors.

His crops, which once stood out against the gray dirt of the farm fields nearby, can no longer be seen.""It's all destroyed,"" Auwal said"" September 20, 2010: ""Abuja ? The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has traced the cause of the devastating flooding that ravaged communities in Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi States to the release of large volume of water from the Goronyo Dam in Sokoto State; and warns that so far, other rivers and streams on that routes may be affected, especially in communities in Niger and Kwara States that host the Kanji dam.The acting Director General of the agency, Dr. Charles Agbo further explained that rather than using helicopters to monitor the areas of the flood, the agency has triggered the UN-SPIDER for the imageries of the extent of the flooding in both Sokoto and Kebbi States.He added that UN-SPIDER, based in Vienna, is United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response aimed at providing universal access to all types of space-based information and services relevant to disaster management by being a gateway to space information for disaster management support and serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities.In a press release, signed by Yushau A. Shuaib, Head of Press and Public Relations, NEMA, Agbo was quoted as speaking after reassessing the extent of damages in Kebbi State where 30 villages and towns were adversely affected by flood that uprooted corpses from their graves; contaminated water, destroyed large farmlands and killed animals.He urged states to harness the potentials of huge water as resources for agriculture and preservation for future usage. He also advised the states to be adequately prepared for heavy flooding to avoid another catastrophe. He recommended that the governments should build barriers along river banks and move people away from low-lying places by the rivers and adopt strategic measures to control the flood.According to the statement, apart from distributing relief material to Katsina, Sokoto over similar incidents, the agency has responded to the plights of thousands victims that are being accommodated in Internally Displaced Persons camps in Argungu and Augi local government councils in the states with four truckloads of relief materials including foods, beverages, disinfectants, detergent, beddings, clothing and medicationsGovernor Saidu Dakingari while commending the NEMA's intervention in the rescue operation blamed the incidents on lack of maintenance of the dams especially Goronyo, Bakolori and Lubu that have either overflown the edges or collapsed due to poor infrastructure that cannot withstand the floods."" September 13, 2010: "" Thousands, including women and children from several villages have been displaced by flood in Argungu, Kebbi State, even as thousands are trapped and cannot be reached. The flood was caused by a spillover from Goronyo dam in Sokoto state.LEADERSHIP SUNDAY investigations reveal that already, Matan Fada, Mala, Gobirawa, Tungar Barke da Tungar Dangwari areas have been submerged. Other local governments affected are Gada, Illela, Gwadabawa, Goronyo, Wurno, Binji, Tangaza, Kware, Wamakko, Bodinga, S/Birni and Sokoto North.The situation was further compounded by the collapse of Danbachaka dam, built 20 years ago. Although the trapped victims could not be reached, there are indications that lives may have been lost.Yusuf Dingyadi, an indigene of the town told LEADERSHIP SUNDAY that victims of the flood are sheltered in Tiggi, Bubuce, and Kantakwale Secondary Schools, with the hospital in a chaotic condition. ""Some victims suffered shock and fatigue, while some animals were drowned. Few lives may have been lost. People migrated to Argungu town for shelter and relief,"" he explained.In a related development, the authorities of Danfodiyo University Sokoto, has announced the closure of the school as a result of massive flood in the area.Meanwhile, the Emir of Argungu last night, visited some shelters along with representatives of Governor Dakingari and Senator Umar Abubakar for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation.Fears of cholera outbreak have also been expressed by indigenes as there is scarcity of food and drinking water.

According to Yel, the rapid assessment conducted recently by the state's government in collaboration with international organizations had indicated that the number of houses partially damaged stood at more than 140. ""A total number of 147 flood-related damages have been recorded in Hai Muozabin alone. Those completely damaged stand at 66.

In the same vein, over 18 water sources are reported to have been damaged, 91 pit latrines affected and over 20 household kitchen gardens submerged. Also, six schools and a number of health facilities were amongst a host of others damaged. ""Two offices have lost access to the town because of floods. The DDR [Disarmament, Demobilization and Rehabilitation programme] and census offices are out of reach by vehicles. They are not accessible at all.

Asked about how the state's government was responding to the natural calamity, he explained that his administration has accorded priority to evacuating affected population to high lying areas. ""The state administration is responding and what has been done so far as priority is the relocation of the affected people to high lying areas. The high lying areas have already been identified and the victims are currently sheltered in two camps. Each camp is accommodating over 368 people.

""Over the last decade, Mercy Corps has developed a relationship of trust and respect with the North Korean people,"" said Jim White, Mercy Corps Vice President of Program Operations. ""At this critical time, we want to reach out to families who are suffering huge losses as a result of flooding."" The UN estimates that in hard-hit North Pyongan province, flooding has heavily damaged or destroyed more than 7,100 homes, and 17,790 acres of farmland have been submerged or washed away. Heavy rains have washed out numerous bridges and railway lines, and created widespread power and telecommunications outages. The flooding has also jeopardized North Korea's already-fragile agricultural capacity, reportedly inundating or washing away valuable crop lands - sparking fears of widespread food shortages. Mercy Corps has worked with vulnerable North Korean families and communities since 1996, striving to help meet health and nutritional needs as well as collaborating on long-term agricultural and economic solutions. In 2008, Mercy Corps was the lead of five aid agencies that implemented a groundbreaking USAID-funded food program in Chagang and North Pyongan Provinces. The organization's co-founder, Ells Culver, reached out to the North Korean people after the country suffered years of drought, flooding and food shortages. That diplomacy has led to an extraordinary partnership that includes farmer exchanges between North Korea and the United States' Pacific Northwest. Mercy Corps has long been at the forefront of efforts to bring reconciliation and mutual understanding to the sometimes-contentious relationship between North Korea and the United States. Through the East Asia Advisory Committee and National Committee for North Korea, Mercy Corps is bringing together various stakeholders to discuss ideas for collaboration.

""We've received reports of the seriousness of the flooding in North Korea,"" King said. ""The North Korean government reached out to these three non-government organizations that we're working with and to another NGO and requested assistance.""King added the groups will use the money primarily for medical supplies and will fly the aid into Pyongyang beginning this week. The aid comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity surrounding North Korea. Washington has imposed additional sanctions on Pyongyang in response to the deadly sinking of a South Korean war ship earlier this year. And former U.S. President Jimmy Carter recently traveled to North Korea to secure the release of an American jailed for illegally entering the country.King dismissed speculation that the assistance is a political tool to lure North Korea back to international talks on its nuclear program.""Our humanitarian assistance is provided solely on the basis of the need and our ability to provide the assistance and to monitor that it's being received by those in need,"" he said.  "

Reports today said waters in the city were receding, after the government weather bureau, the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology Department, said yesterday that the level of the Pegu River was still rising at 11.30 a.m., without giving exact rate or height. However, state-run media reported today that the level of the Pegu River had reached 30 feet (924 centimetres) at noon yesterday, 5.5 inches above the ?danger mark?.  Hundreds of flood victims were being sheltered in three Buddhist monasteries on the outskirts of the city. Though exact numbers of flood victims were unavailable to Mizzima, residents and monks in the areas estimated that the number was definitely more than 3,000.?Today, the water has receded and the situation is not bad as it was. Yesterday, many people became homeless and there are more than 500 taking shelter in my monastery,? an abbott from one of the monasteries said. Mizzima learned yesterday that about 5,000 homes on Shwe Thar Liaung Road, and in the Kyaukkyisuu, Zaiganaing, Ywathit and Kyuntharyar wards of Pegu, were evacuated as floodwaters rose. All schools in those areas were closed.Prahita monastery Abbot Keik Ti and his devotees yesterday distributed food packets to flood victims in the city, but a resident said yesterday that ?even motorcycles and cars were facing difficulty commuting?. ?We could not even reach the market.

The floods that swept through the country began in the northwestern Swat Valley and were at their most ferocious. Only one of 51 bridges survived. Hundreds of homes and businesses were swept away in hours. The floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of 2010 took 2,000 lives and affected 20 million people, of whom 7 million remain homeless.. At their peak, one-fifth of Pakistan was under water, more than 3 meters (10 feet) deep in some places. As the disaster slowly unfolded, a world that had just opened its wallets for Haiti's earthquake victims was called upon to respond again. The militaries of the U.S., Japan and Australia joined the rescue effort, while other nations sent tents, medicines and relief goods.The U.N. says just over $760 million has so far been donated ? less than half of what it says is needed to help all those affected Three months later, Associated Press correspondents visited towns and villages in the four hardest hit regions along the 4,000-km (2,500-mile) trail of destruction to witness a nation struggling to recover ? with varying degrees of success.SWAT VALLEY, north Pakistan ? The upper reaches of this valley are again passable ? on a road hacked out of hillsides and over creaky bridges by villagers using shovels, pickaxes or their bare hands.The road stands as a tribute to their resolve to rebuild what was lost when the worst floods in memory hit the remote and scenic valley.But it takes 14 hours to drive its 50 kilometers (30 miles) of boulder-strewn dirt and bridges made of salvaged timber. And journey's end ? a holiday resort-turned-ghost town ? shows the challenges that remain.""It is a test given by God,"" said Abdul Wadood, who crammed with 15 dusty and exhausted members of his family into a jeep headed down the valley. As he spoke an explosion echoed through the valley. Army engineers were trying to widen the track.The floods that swept through the country began in the northwestern Swat Valley and were at their most ferocious. Only one of 51 bridges survived. Hundreds of homes and businesses were swept away in hours. Electricity plants were destroyed, along with hotels for the tourists who frequent Swat's beauty spots.American army Chinook helicopters still crisscross the valley, ferrying food, building materials and passengers. But for now, a handmade road is the only route for travelers heading to warmer areas as winter approaches.Commanders of the army force, which is still in the valley after last year's anti-Taliban offensive, say the civilians did 90 percent of the road work. ""Rely on the government?"" said Abul Razaq, a 70-year-old man shoring up a bridge with sand and stones. ""We have to solve our problems on our own."" The road reaches Kalam, a mountain-ringed holiday town at the top of the valley that was ravaged by the floods. Even before the flooding, Taliban violence had scared away most of visitors.

Kalam Khan fills a sling with wheat seeds and sets off behind his oxen and plow, sowing land that two months ago was under 1.5 meters (five feet) of water. In the next field, children bounce on the back of a tractor turning soil.Many farmers in northwest Pakistan couldn't imagine growing a winter wheat crop this year, yet thousands are doing so, and others farther south will begin soon, easing fears of shortages in the country's staple food.Yet, nationwide the outlook remains bleak for many farmers, who account for most of the 20 million affected by the floods. Large areas of Sindh province in the south remain under water. Irrigation channels across the country have silted up, and over a million farm animals died in the devastation..Some officials see a comforting irony: They predict some bumper harvests because the floods dumped fresh nutrients on the soil.Farmers are less sure. ""The old people around here say sometimes it has a good effect, sometimes bad,"" said Mohammed Tariq, who owns about a hectare (two acres) of land by the River Bara, which burst its banks in late July. ""We will have to wait and see what nature does.""The U.N. is distributing sacks of wheat seeds and fertilizer to 150,000 households in the northwest. Families also receive a smaller amount of peas, spinach, turnip and tomato seeds. The wheat seeds are paid for by the U.S., and come in sacks stamped ""A gift from the American people.""At a nearby village warehouse, farmers line up to pick up their bags of seeds and take them back to their homes in wheelbarrows or on donkey-drawn carts along streets where flood waters were once 10 feet high.""This is good, hard seed,"" said Khan as he dropped the red wheat seeds down a chute into a furrow cut by the wooden plow ? a technique thousands of years old. ""It is the best we have seen around here. Let's hope for a good crop.""?By CHRIS BRUMMITT"" August 11, 2010: ""Pakistan warned of fresh flooding along vast stretches of the Indus basin, as engineers raced to shore up defenses in the country?s sixth-largest city and reopen roads that have cut off the biggest refinery.More rains are expected in the next 24 hours in central Punjab province and in the northwest, the worst-hit region, Muhammad Riaz, the chief meteorologist in Karachi, said by phone. Information Minister Qamar Zaman said 722,000 homes have already been damaged and flooded roads are hampering relief efforts.The United Nations appealed for $460 million in aid today to assist at least six million people displaced by a wave of water that has descended on Pakistan?s economic heartland. Almost 700,000 hectares of standing crops are under water or destroyed by floodwaters, the Food and Agriculture Organization said. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. closed its Multan plant, which processes a third of the country?s crude oil.As many as 50 million people have been affected, John Holmes, the UN?s emergency relief coordinator, said in New York.?The number of people affected is much larger than the Pakistan earthquake of 2005, the tsunami,? that struck the Indian Ocean basin in 2004 or the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that devastated Haiti in January, Holmes told journalists.?Pakistan has never seen a disaster of this scale,? Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, the nation?s biggest rescue service, said by telephone from Peshawar, predicting at least 2,200 people may have died so far. ?We need to rebuild everything from scratch and the biggest challenge is rehabilitation.?Southern Punjab province may face ?critical flooding? between now and Aug. 14, Shafaqat Ahmed, the military commander for Multan said at a news conference today. A third flood peak may hit the area at the end of the month, he said.Cotton, rice, sugarcane and maize crops have been damaged and fruit orchards have been washed away by the monsoon rains, putting at risk the government?s farm output growth target of 3.8 percent for the year that started July 1.Almost two weeks after much of the northwest was first inundated, southern Sindh province is being ravaged by water flowing down the Indus at up to 10 times the normal volume.Jacobabad, Sukkur and Larkana are among districts at risk. Low-lying areas of Hyderabad, Pakistan?s sixth-largest city, may be inundated within 24 hours.?Our protective arrangements are all in place,? said Abdul Qadir Paleejo, executive engineer at the Kotri Barrage, a dam spanning the Indus 8 kilometers (5 miles) northwest of Hyderabad, a industrial city of 1.6 million people. ?We have strengthened our embankments and protective walls.?City officials began evacuating residents yesterday. The Kotri Barrage is the last dam along the swollen Indus as flood waters make their way to the sea, leaving behind a trail of unprecedented destruction.Officials say the flood?s worst damage may be done at Hyderabad, the biggest population center directly on the 3,200- kilometer long Indus River. The city is home to textile mills and assembly plants for motorcycles and cars.?The barrage has the capacity to withstand a flow of 875,000 cubic feet per second, while the incoming tide is carrying a flow of 800,000,? Paleejo said from his office at the dam. ?We are hoping it will pass without causing any damage.?Pakistan said yesterday it will waive farm loans and help rebuild homes for victims of the floods as the government and aid agencies acknowledged they are unable to reach or assist many of the 14 million uprooted so far.The floods have knocked Pakistan back to the ?primordial? era, the country?s ambassador to the UN, Abdullah Haroon, told journalists in New York. ?Six thousand villages have been wiped from the face of the earth.?The government will announce a sweeping rehabilitation package once it completes a survey of lives lost and damage to property, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan cited Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani as saying. A cross-party committee will coordinate relief activities, he said, after visiting camps in Muzaffargarh and Layyah.The World Bank said today it will assess needs and draft a reconstruction plan for affected regions.In Baluchistan province, ?our stockpiles are nearly exhausted,? and trucks hauling tents have been blocked for a week by flooded roads, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in an e-mailed message.With more than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of Pakistan under water, the agency has delivered tents to people that have no dry land on which to pitch them.About 1,600 people are known to have died in Pakistan, and hundreds more in India and Afghanistan, from flooding caused by heavy monsoon rains. The death toll may jump as more inundated areas become accessible, Edhi said.Many people have died from the outbreak of diseases such as diarrhea and flood victims are in need of basic medicines, blankets and tents, Edhi said.At least 500,000 people made homeless in the northwest are seeking shelter in public buildings and tent camps erected on high ground and along roads, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.The United States and Islamic militant groups, both pushing for influence in the world?s sixth-most populous country, have sent teams to help homeless villagers in areas of the ethnic Pashtun northwest that for two years have been combat zones.Pak-Arab Refinery?s plant at Multan, the nation?s biggest refinery, has been shut as a precaution due to the floods and may start supplying fuel within a week, company spokesman Saad Husain said by phone from Karachi. Natural gas output has fallen after floods forced the closure of a well at the Qadirpur field.The U.S. yesterday pledged an additional $20 million in emergency aid, bringing its total promised to $55 million, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley told reporters.Australia said today its air force will send two C-17 Globemaster aircraft this week to deliver emergency supplies.""August 3, 2010: ""TRescue teams in northern Pakistan are battling to reach tens of thousands of people cut off by monsoon flooding.While water is receding in some areas, many communities remain cut off by the region's worst flooding for 80 years.Unicef said 3m people had been affected and more than 1,400 had been killed. The government said some 27,000 people remained trapped and awaiting help.Renewed rain on Tuesday slowed the relief effort, with criticism rising of the pace of the government response.In the Swat Valley, where thousands are still rebuilding after a major military operation against the Taliban during 2009, the flooding has brought down bridges and left communities cut off.""The civil administration is totally zero in helping,"" one medical student, Abdullah, told the BBC.""There [are] no aid agencies here at the moment - I haven't seen anyone, because more than 25 bridges have been swept away. These are the metal bridges for carrying transport."" The Malakand region, which includes Swat, is among the worst-affected areas. Villages in Malakand have suffered heavy casualties, with roads and bridges washed away.Adnan Khan, a spokesman for the disaster management authority in the worst-affected province, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, told Reuters news agency that logistics were now an immense challenge.""The entire infrastructure we built in the last 50 years has been destroyed,"" he said.The BBC's Lyse Doucet, in Islamabad, says the flooding would be a challenge in any country, but is a growing crisis for a country like Pakistan, already suffering economic woes and a Taliban insurgency.The return of monsoon rains has grounded helicopters and raised fears of renewed flooding.Forecasters said moderate to heavy rain would continue in the north-west and in southern provinces of Punjab and Sindh over the coming days.""Enhanced monsoon activity"" is also expected to continue during the first two weeks of August.Just as emergency services and the army said they were making some headway, the rains have come again. That has meant an immediate suspension of helicopter flights to stranded people.We've had about two hours of very heavy downpours. It has just eased up but more are expected in the coming hours - floodwaters could rise again and rivers will burst their banks again. Aid operations will have to be suspended for even longer.There are many areas the army admits that it has not reached at all. There are several valleys in the north-west of Pakistan where they do not know how many people have died or how much destruction there is. Time is now crucial for those people waiting for aid, who do not yet have food or clean water.The army had hoped that the initial rescue operation could be over in 10 days, but says rebuilding the damaged areas could take more than six months.Local official Mian Iftikhar Hussain said rescue teams were trying to reach 27,000 stranded people, including 1,500 tourists in the Swat Valley.But the biggest challenge for the emergency services is access, as so many areas had their transport and communication links destroyed and are now isolated.There are also concerns that yet more places could flood: a warning was issued to villages close to the Warsak Dam overnight, but no evacuation order was issued.The Pakistani military says it has committed 30,000 troops and dozens of helicopters to the relief effort, but winching individuals to safety is a slow process.Unconfirmed reports say that Islamist groups, some accused of having links to the Taliban, have been providing aid to many of the victims.Some survivors have complained that the government has responded slowly; several hundred people protested in the city of Peshawar, where homeless survivors have crammed into temporary shelters, and there have been angry scenes in Swat. In Nowshera district one flood victim, Faisal Islam, told the Associated Press: ""We need tents. Just look around. This is the only shirt I have. Everything else is buried.""Aid agencies say the risk of water-borne diseases spreading will remain high until the floodwaters fully recede. Mr Hussain, the regional information minister, said there were reports of cholera emerging in the Swat Valley.What aid is arriving in the flood zone is in high demand Ahmed Farah Shadoul, the World Health Organization's acting head in Pakistan, told the BBC it was essential to act against the spread of a number of infections, including diarrhoeal diseases, skin problems, eye problems, malaria, fevers and measles.The UN children's agency Unicef said more than a million children needed emergency aid.Dr Shadoul said he had received reports of people being bitten by snakes, and said WHO had provided anti-venom in some regions.Food is scarce in the area and water supplies have been contaminated by the floods.Unicef says it has been working with the Pakistani authorities to repair wells and provide chlorine tablets for drinking water.Governments around the world have pledged millions of dollars in aid, but there has been no decision yet on whether to launch a global appeal for aid."" ""ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The worst floods in memory in Pakistan have devastated the lives of more than 3 million people, a U.N. spokesman said on Tuesday, while outrage over the unpopular government's response to the suffering spreads.The catastrophe, which started almost a week ago and has killed more than 1,400 people, is likely to deepen as more rains are expected and a breakout of water-borne diseases such as cholera could create a health crisis.It has also called once again into question the leadership of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is already juggling a Taliban insurgency and chronic power cuts in the nuclear-armed U.S. ally.Poorly resourced Pakistani authorities are struggling to help flood victims, many of whom have lost everything and say they received no warnings that raging waters were heading their way.Anger was palpable in towns such as Charssada. A Reuters reporter saw people attacking trucks distributing relief items. Police then charged at them with batons.Bistma Bibi, 65, who lost two grandsons in the floods, accused state relief workers of only helping friends or relatives. ""I came here at 5 o'clock in the morning. I did my best. I begged and fought but got nothing. They're giving them (supplies) to their people,"" she said.""July 29, 2010: ""Peshawar, Pakistan - At least 113 people have died and thousands more have been made homeless by flash floods triggered by torrential rains that hit north-west Pakistan and Pakistani Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.The army has been summoned to tackle the problems caused by the flood waters, with Swat and Malakand districts the hardest hit.""I can confirm the death of 91 people in the last two days in different areas,"" senior minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Bashir Ahmad Bilour, told reporters.More than 60 people were killed in Malakand alone while Swat itself was cut off as heavy rains swept away several bridges and disrupted communications."" ""Rivers burst their banks during monsoon rains, washing away streets, battering a dam and killing at least 60 people in the most severe floods in decades in northwest Pakistan, officials have said. Hundreds of thousands more were stranded as rescue workers struggled to reach far-flung villages.In the Peshawar area, two elderly men clung to a fence post and each other as a raging torrent swept over their heads, footage on Pakistan's Dunya TV showed. It was unclear whether they survived.People were forced to trudge through knee-deep water in some streets in the Swat Valley. A newly constructed part of a dam in the Charsadda district collapsed, while crops were soaked in many areas. At least 10 people died near Peshawar when their homes collapsed.Dozens of people were reported missing, including at least nine Chinese construction workers in the Kohistan area. Some 200 other Chinese workers were trapped amid the downpour, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister for Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, the province that has been deluged.He said it was the worst floods in the north-west since 1929 and estimated 400,000 people were stranded around the north-west.""A rescue operation using helicopters cannot be conducted due to the bad weather, while there are only 48 rescue boats available for rescue,"" he said, noting weather forecasts predict more rain over the next day.Monsoon season often leads to widespread flooding in Pakistan, and the poorest residents are often most at risk because flood-prone areas are all they can afford.The torrential rain this week is a suspected factor in a plane crash in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, that killed 152 people on Wednesday""""At least 43 killed as a result of monsoon rains and flooding across the country"""

Some of them contained trimethyl chloro silicane, a colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent smell.The Songhua River is the main source of drinking water for Jilin, the province's second-largest city.Emergency teams mobilized to recover the spilled fluid have so far recovered 400 containers. The teams tested the water and have determined it to be chemical-free, a government spokesman said.An explosion at a plant owned by the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company in November 2005 caused 100 tons of potentially lethal benzene to spill into the Songhua River.

It's basically removing whatever was in somebody's basement out and into dumpsters to be transported out or trying to salvage those things,"" he said.The flood has forced about 175 people from their homes.

More than 70 Saskatchewan communities have declared states of emergency due to bad weather.Severe flooding last month in Maple Creek, in southwestern Saskatchewan, flooded basements and collapsed a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway.

The scale has a maximum rating of F5.Meteorologist Dan Kulak said in a conference call Monday that the twister was about 500 metres wide, cut a path 45 kilometres long ? crossing two highways ? and may have been on the ground for as long as one hour.""That would be a fairly lengthy storm,"" said Kulak.""Typically tornadoes will be on the ground for only a few minutes, but the odd time you do get these storms which do last a considerable amount of time and cover a lot of distance. So a one-hour tornado on the ground that peaks at an F3 is an unusual storm. It's not an extremely, extremely rare event but certainly it is in the less common end of things.""Kulak said F3 tornadoes probably occur once every two to three years on Prairies.It was an F3 tornado that carved a 20-kilometre path of destruction through an Alberta campground on July 14, 2000. The twister at Pine Lake killed 12 people and injured more than 100.Residents near Raymore and on the Kawacatoose First Nation say it's a miracle that no one was killed or even seriously injured during the tornado Friday.Kulak said ""it's been wave after wave"" of storms across the Prairies.The meteorologist said he doesn't have a specific forecast through to the end of August, but he suggested there might be more bad weather to come.""Certainly if history is going to be any indication of the future here, when we do get into patterns like this ? a lot of rain and a lot moisture that happens to be in the area ? you're that much more susceptible to further thunderstorm activity,"" said Kulak.""You tend to recycle.

The small plane carrying Piedras Negras Mayor Jose Manuel Maldonado was flying over a rain-swollen reservoir about 25 miles east of Eagle Pass, Texas, when it went down, said Ricardo Castillo, a spokesman for the border state of Coahuila. State spokeswoman Irma Flores said there were no survivors. She said the dead included state Public Works Director Horacio Del Bosque, the pilot and three other people. The cause of the crash was still under investigation. The officials were surveying the condition of reservoirs along the U.S.-Mexico border, which have reached their highest levels in decades following days of drenching rain. That has forced officials to dump water into flooded rivers, with yet another storm on the way. The dramatic rise of the Rio Grande caused by Hurricane Alex and continuing rains forced the closure of at least one major border crossing between downtown Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Officials evacuated the flood-threatened Vega Verde subdivision in Del Rio, Texas, some 110 miles upstream from Laredo, while high waters in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila have already damaged some 10,000 homes - many swamped in waist-deep water. ""That means there are 40,000 people who don't have any place to sleep,"" Gov. Humberto Moreira told the Televisa network on Wednesday. To the southeast, Mexican officials evacuated nearly 18,000 people from houses in Ciudad Anahuac for fear that water would overflow the Venustiano Carranza dam and threaten lives. Mexico's National Water Commission said the dam currently had the largest emergency water release in the country. Ciudad Anahuac Mayor Santos Garza Garcia said at least 1,500 homes already had been flooded in the town of Rodriguez, across the Salado River from his city. Water behind the binational Amistad Dam on the Rio Grande was at its highest level since 1974, according to the International Boundary and Water Commission, forcing officials to release water from it at the fastest rate in a quarter century. The Commission said the downstream Falcon dam would probably reach capacity within the next few days, suggesting future releases there will raise water levels along the river's lower reaches. Much of that downstream area is protected against flooding by levees, but Mexico's National Water Commission said it was worried about low-lying settlements, most built by poor people without official permission. ""One of country's most serious problems are irregular settlements on federal land and in flood-prone areas,"" it said. Authorities walked a painful, delicate line - forced to release reservoir waters they know will add to flooding in hopes of avoiding worse disasters. It was an unusual state of affairs in a semiarid region where Mexican and U.S. officials often squabble over rights to scarce water. Mayor Garza Garcia said 20 floodgates had been opened by late Tuesday at the Venustiano Carranza Dam, which was releasing 600 cubic meters per second into the Salado River, a tributary of the Rio Grande. ""It was preferable having controlled flooding than having the whole town disappear,"" Garza Garcia said. ""The situation is very critical."" Luis Lobo, who drove 16 people from Ciudad Anahuac to Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of people from Ciudad Anahuac and nearby villages left by foot and were by the side of the road. ""They are out in the open. Men, women, and children with nothing to eat,"" Lobo said after arriving in Nuevo Laredo. Garza Garcia said soldiers planned to take food to those stranded. Sally Spener, public affairs officer for the binational Water Commission that operates the Amistad Dam, said the agency had tried to limit releases ""so that we would not exacerbate the flooding."" In Laredo, city spokeswoman Xochitl Mora said Bridge One was closed as a precaution ahead of the expected crest on Thursday. The water is expected to rise to 38.5 feet high enough to touch but not run over the bridge. Officials will remove the heavy steel shade canopies to ease the weight on Bridge One before the heaviest water pressure comes with the river crest, she said. About 11,000 pedestrians and 13,000 vehicles use the bridge daily. Officials were also evacuating 2,000 people near the swollen Rio Escondido, said Piedras Negras Mayor Jose Manuel Maldonado. And in Texas authorities evacuated the Vega Verde neighborhood of Del Rio was evacuated as more water was being released from the Amistad Lake, just upstream. One of three international bridges connecting Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, was ordered closed as the Rio Grande rose dramatically. The water is expected to rise to 38.5 feet - high enough to touch but not run over the bridge. The other two Laredo bridges, including the heavily used World Trade Bridge, are expected to remain open. Hurricane Alex dumped heavy rains on the region last week, causing flooding that killed at least 12 people in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, where Ciudad Anahuac is located, and leaving some 130,000 without water service. The U.S. National Weather Service said a new storm was likely to make its way across the Gulf of Mexico and hit the region within a day or two. "" July 6, 2010: ""Hundreds of people have been evacuated and a border bridge closed in northern Mexico after days of rain caused flooding and water to swell behind a dam.Authorities in Coahuila state have closed the border bridge in Ciudad Acuna as a precautionary measure after water released from the Amistad dam raised the level of the Rio Grande. Ciudad Acuna lies across the border from Del Rio, Texas.Coahuila Gov. Humberto Moreira told local media Monday that about 10,000 people have suffered severe damage to their homes or possessions due to the flooding.The release of water from the Amistad dam raises the possibility that river levels could rise downstream in Piedras Negras, a city across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas"" . July 2, 2010: ""At least six people have died during heavy flooding in Mexico. The victims were killed in and around the northern city of Monterrey following storms caused by Hurricane Alex. One woman was crushed to death by a mudslide as large rocks from surrounding mountains crashed down onto her car. President Felipe Calderon said that 1,200 had been dispatched to help in the relief efforts.Hurricane Alex hit Mexico's Gulf Coast on Wednesday and moved inland. A year's worth of rain fell in three days in Monterrey, swelling the normally dry Santa Catarina river, which overflowed and destroyed homes and sections of roads. Tens of thousands of home are now without water or power and many residents have evacuated in search of emergency shelters."" July 1, 2010: ""Hurricane Alex has brought torrential rain as it weakened to a tropical storm over northeastern Mexico, flooding the city of Monterrey. At least two people were killed when a river burst its banks, inundating roads and washing away cars. Alex was a category two hurricane when it hit the Gulf coast on Wednesday night, but lost force as it moved inland. It was expected to dissipate over the Mexican highlands on Friday.The usually dry Santa Catarina river that runs through the centre of Monterrey turned into a raging torrent, flooding major highways and paralysing Mexico's third-biggest city. One man died after he was swept nearly 500 metres by the waters and trapped against a fence. The body of another drowned man was found in a creek.A 12-tonne statue of the revered Virgin of Guadalupe was knocked off its plinth on the river bank. Flood waters also hit the city zoo, sweeping animals including buffalo from their pens, the Reuters news agency reported. Alex was the first hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic season, and the first to appear in June since 1995. It caused severe flooding along Mexico's Gulf coast when it made landfall on Wednesday night.  The coastal town of Matamoros also suffered Emergency workers in the port city of Matamoros have been using boats to assess the damage in some neighbourhoods. ""The city is practically under water"" the director of civil defence, Saul Hernandez, told the AP news agency. ""But the most important thing is there was no loss of life. We took opportune measures to evacuate people"" Thousands of people in coastal villages were moved to higher ground before the storm hit. Many towns were left without electricity, and phone lines were also down. Heavy seas caused by the storm also disrupted BP's oil spill clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico. Alex largely spared the US state of Texas, which had prepared for a possible direct hit. It brought heavy rain and caused at least two tornadoes, but there were no reports of injuries or major damage. However, there are still warnings of possible flash-flooding in some areas of the state.""July 1, 2010: ""Alex has drenched much of northern Mexico, paralysing the major city of Monterrey. At least two people were killed when the dry river roared to life and roads turned into rushing streams.Hurricane Alex ripped off roofs, caused severe flooding and forced thousands of people to flee coastal fishing villages as it hit land on Wednesday evening in the border state of Tamaulipas. Power and telephone service were down in several towns and cities. The storm weakened to a tropical storm as it moved west to Nuevo Leon state, but still caused major disruptions.One man died when he was swept away by a torrent of water along a six-lane highway, city Civil Protection director Pedro Trevino told Televisa Monterrey network. Another man was found drowned by side of a creek.Nuevo Leon state governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz told the network he had ordered all schools closed and appealed for people to stay home from all but essential jobs.

Police on Tuesday identified the final known victim from the flood.""While the Forest Service will have sole jurisdiction from here forward, Arkansas stands ready to help if any additional assistance is requested,"" Beebe said in a statement released by his office.State police had already scaled back their search efforts on Tuesday, and a spokesman said the state police mobile command center would leave Thursday morning.""At this time, there has been no other individual noted who may be unaccounted for,"" State Police spokesman Bill Sadler said Wednesday.The U.S. Forest Service said it had shifted its attention to assessing damage from the floods and cleaning up debris. A spokeswoman for the agency said she did not know when the campground would reopen.""It will likely take a week or so for the initial assessments just to give us a better idea of what kind of damages were caused by the floods,"" said Tracy Farley, of the service's Ouachita National Forest division.Beebe's office also said the governor has been in touch with Forest Service officials about potential federal assistance for the victims' families and for those who assisted with the search efforts.Lawmakers continued to focus attention on what steps could be taken to better notify campers in remote campsites of impending emergencies.Sen. Mark Pryor said he planned to meet with Forest Service officials to discuss ways to improve communications. The agency is reviewing how to improve communication after Friday's flash flooding.Weather forecasters warned of the flooding four times over the course of an hour.But the campsite did not have a ranger on duty, cell phone service was spotty and weather radio signals did not reach there.Pryor said the solution may be as simple as warning bells set up at the camp, or an informational campaign.""My preference would be something simple and low-tech,"" Pryor said. ""I've heard a lot of different ideas over the last few days, but the bottom line is those folks were asleep when this happened and even if they had gotten a radio signal down there ... I'm not sure that a lot of them would have heard it.""Campers would have been told about a flash flood watch posted at midday Thursday, but the flood arrived after 2 a.m. Friday when many were asleep. At times, the Little Missouri River rose eight feet per hour"" June 11, 2010: ""At least 12 people died at an Arkansas campground after heavy rain and flash flooding and many more could be trapped in the area, state authorities said.Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe told CNN there's word from the Red Cross that there could have been as many as 300 people in the rugged area of western Arkansas, but he said there is no registration that would show the precise number of people in the region -- which is in the Albert Pike campground area.Bill Sadler, a state police spokesman who confirmed the death toll to CNN -- said a search is on for people still trapped in the area, a relatively remote and rural region where cell phone service could be spotty.""The primary mission of the Arkansas State Police working with local authorities right now is to get the living out of the area and locate the dead,"" Sadler told CNN.Video: 12 killed in Arkansas campground flood He said two helicopters are working to locate and assist in rescuing the living. He said local authorities are providing search volunteers and a temporary morgue has been set up.Beebe said the water of the Little Missouri River rose from about 3 feet Thursday night to more than 20 feet early Friday in the U.S. Forest Service campground.""It was a very rapid flash flood that inundated that area,"" Beebe said. ""It's an unmanned campground in terms of being a campground with all the amenities.""He said rescue crews on foot, in helicopters, and in vehicles were combing the area. He said law enforcement, National Guard and parks personnel were working on the search-and-rescue efforts"

Fico also praised the work of local authorities, who probably saved thousands of lives by evacuating people promptly as the flood waters threatened. Across the country, flooding has swollen rivers and ponds to levels higher than can be measured by existing metres. Interior Minister Robert Kalinak noted that some communities which have never before experienced flooding are now facing flooding. Because they have no experience with floods, they are totally unprepared, he said. Fico warned of the likelihood that the receding waters could cause heavy damage to the country's railways and bridges. More than 3,000 troops have been deployed nationwide to support firefighters. Fico's left-wing Direction-Social Democratic party, like other competitors in the upcoming June 12 national elections, has suspended campaigning during the floods and opted to donate money earmarked for the race to flood victims.

(CBC)Motorists who had their vehicles damaged during the storms have also begun to file claims with Manitoba Public Insurance.So far, more than 200 flood-related claims have been filed, said MPI spokesman Brian Smiley.About half the claims come from Winnipeg, where many vehicles sustained damage after going through underpasses filled with water and becoming partially submerged.Other vehicles were hit by debris, even trees, tossed about by strong winds. Claims from outside the city are vehicles damaged because they were parked in low-lying areas and were swamped.Flooding across city Calls to the city about flooded basements came from nearly every neighbourhood and are not concentrated in one area, officials said. ""It doesn't make you happy when you see people moving out mattresses and beds to their back yards and having to get pumps to pump out the water,"" said Mayor Sam Katz, who viewed some of the damage Sunday in the city's Transcona neighbourhood.""There were some very bad scenarios."" A sign for the golf cart path is nearly submerged on the flooded Transcona golf course Sunday. (Richard Romanow)In addition to seeping into basements, the rain washed debris into streets and clogged drains, which resulted in the development of large pools of water spreading across streets and into yards.Some roadways were barricaded to keep vehicles from passing through dangerously deep water.Transcona resident John Tubicz was at a local hardware store at noon Sunday and watched people frantically buy up the stock of pumps to get water out of their basements.""People were racing to the sump pumps and within seconds the shelf was empty,"" he said.He estimates the damage in his basement at a few thousand dollars.'You know, I can't cry. It's beyond that point.' ?Winnipegger Diane WitwickiAnother city resident, Diane Witwicki, was having trouble comprehending the amount of damage in her home.""Insulation, the paneling. Everything.

It's beyond that point.""Problems at the pumps Some of the problems in South Transcona can be traced back to a problem at the pumping station that serves the area, said Randy Hull, Winnipeg's emergency preparedness coordinator.""All three pumps at one point had failed. When I visited there about 2:30 a.m. [Monday] they were not operational, but when I went by at 8:30 a.m. they were in operation,"" he said.Despite the faulty pumps, the city is not responsible for flooded basements in the area because the storm was an act of God, Hull said.In Brandon, the thunderstorms did much of the same damage to yards and basements, while also uprooting several trees across the city. Rick Bailey, director of parks and recreation, said the clean-up should take all week.""[The] soil's just become so saturated, and then when you get that wind that come through, that's where a lot of the trees come over,"" he said.The Assiniboine Community College's North Hill campus was badly hit with about 25 toppled trees.Rising riverThe rainfall has also raised the level of the Red River and prompted officials to activate the floodway, a 48-kilometre channel that diverts water around the eastern side of Winnipeg.Flood Forecaster Alf Warkentin said the Red River in through Winnipeg went up nearly three metres on the weekend and could rise another half-metre by the end of Tuesday.Most of the tributaries leading into the Red and Assiniboine River have emptied, so the rate of the increase is dropping off.High river levels in Winnipeg impact the city sewer system's ability to operate at a normal capacity. That means there is an increased risk of basement flooding as the overloaded system backs up through household sewer lines that aren't protected by sump pumps and backwater valves."""

The extent of the damage across the region became apparent yesterday as surface flooding receded and the clean-up operation began. Waitaki Civil Defence spokesman Scott Ridley today said the area was slowly returning to normal. ""Some places that were looking like lakes are starting to look normal, even if they are sodden,"" he said. ""Our roads aren't in ideal condition any more but we'll get on to fixing them over the coming months."" Mr Ridley said about 50 rural roads remained closed, but some could reopen as contractors assessed and prioritised repairs. The about 3500 residents of Palmerston in Waitaki district remained on restricted water supplies to prevent contamination from polluted water, he said. The local reservoir has enough water for three days, provided residents conserved water, and the main supply would be restored once the Shag River level dropped. An New Zealand Army Unimog, police and civil defence staff delivered food and water over the weekend to areas isolated because of high water and land slips. Mr Ridley said while some residents remained cut off, they were ""all sorted"". It was too early to say how much the clean-up effort would cost, although it was likely to be in the millions, he said.

NITEROI: Rescuers raced against time yesterday amid fading hopes of finding survivors of a huge mudslide, with over 400 people now feared dead in some of the worst flooding to swamp Brazil in decades. Rescuers painstakingly pulled bodies from the thick mound of dirt and debris in the Niteroi shantytown of Morro do Bumba late on Friday and yesterday, bringing the death toll to 223. Another 200 people were feared to have been buried alive in the slum, itself precariously perched atop a garbage dump in this city just east of Rio de Janeiro. Some 60 hours after the heaviest rains in half a century unleashed floods and mudslides, rescue workers still were far from having finished the work of recovering bodies from beneath tonnes of rocks, rubble and earth. The floods tore through the metropolitan area?s precarious hillside slums, or favelas. Niteroi was hardest hit, with at least 141 dead, according to the civil defence authorities. Across the bay, another 63 were found in Rio de Janeiro. April 7: ""Rio de Janeiro braced for more rain today as the death toll from flooding climbed to 104 and order slowly returned to Brazil's second-biggest city that was thrown into chaos a day earlier.

""From the point of view of mobility, the situation is better than yesterday,"" Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters at an early morning press conference. He urged residents to postpone meetings and avoid travelling in the city if possible. Schools remained shut for a second day. The government weather service predicted rain would continue until Saturday even after clouds broke briefly and rains eased this morning. A Fire Department spokesman said 39 people were killed in the city of Rio, famous for its beaches and Carnaval celebrations, while the remainder of the casualties took place in suburbs and in neighboring cities and town of the state of Rio de Janeiro. In the nearby city of Niteroi, residents desperately searched for survivors in rubble left from 10 houses that collapsed from a mudslide, the Globo network reported. ""I lost my sister-in-law and a niece, and my nephew and brother-in-law are still missing,"" nurse Samuel Franca, who managed to rescue his sister from the wreckage the day before, told Globo. Globo images showed buses struggling to drive through flooded streets in western parts of the city, though transit had largely returned to normal in the central business district. Paes called on those living in hillside slums at risk for mudslides - which were responsible for most of yesterday's deaths - to leave their homes as the rains continued. ""Their lives are at risk,"" Paes added. Brazil's popular football team Flamengo postponed a match with a rival team from Chile because of the rains. The mayor yesterday said 1,200 people had been made homeless and that 10,000 houses remained at risk, mostly in the slums where about a fifth of Rio's people live, often in precarious shacks that are vulnerable to heavy rains. Television images yesterday showed central parts of Rio flooded and abandoned cars under water. Near Copacabana beach, residents waded through ankle-deep water on their way to work.

Floods in 2000 and 2007 forced hundreds of thousands from their homes in the impoverished southern African nation.Since then, Mozambique has minimised the loss of life by evacuating people to higher ground at the start of the rains.But in this year's floods, two people were killed after being swept away by the floodwaters and one person was eaten by a crocodile, according to An official for Mozambique's National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) said the evacuation of thousands of people living along the river bank of the Zambezi and other flood-prone rivers would avert any more deaths.""All the people that were victims of floods in previous years are being moved,"" Luis Pacheco, an official from INGC in the central province of Sofala, was cited by O Pais as saying. - Reuters March 11, 2010: ""Mozambican authorities say about 800 people are trapped by rising floodwaters and in need of rescue"" ..""About 130 000 people are to be evacuated in flood-prone Mozambique because of rising waters in three main rivers, state media said on Wednesday. Government declared a red alert for regions along the mighty Zambezi River, Africa's fourth-longest which originates in Angola, as well as the smaller Pungwe and Buzi rivers, Noticias newspaper said.The red alert imposes an evacuation order for the area.""About 130 000 people were identified in areas of risk in three basins in the central region, namely the Zambezi, Pungwe and Buzi rivers,"" Noticias said.""Our main concern right now is to save human lives. In any case, the situation is under control,"" said Joao Ribeiro, director general of the National Disaster Management Institute.Emergency centres have been created where tents, mosquito nets, medicine and food would be available.Seasonal rains across southern Africa send water levels rising every year around this time, especially on the Zambezi which brings to Mozambique run-off from a long swathe of the continent as it runs toward the Indian Ocean.Mozambique is a frequent victim of flooding during its rainy season. Deadly floods in 2000 and 2007 forced tens of thousands from their homes.So far two flood deaths have been reported this year."".... Flooding in Mozambique and Angola has displaced thousands of families, prompting both governments to step up rescue operations and Mozambican authorities to issue a red alert for some areas.Torrential rain that has swept central Mozambique and southern Angola for weeks has caused some rivers to overflow into villages along their paths and many villagers have fled to higher ground.Mozambique's government issued a red alert late on Tuesday, one step down from declaring a disaster area, and said it would forcibly evacuate about 130,000 people in areas at risk in the centre of the country.A government spokesman said flooding was expected to continue along the Zambezi, Africa's fourth biggest river. The floodgates of the river's Cahora Bassa dam have been opened to ease the pressure on its walls and this was also expected to increase the floods.The poverty-stricken African country said it did not plan to ask for international aid for time being.""All the conditions have been created to evacuate and relocate 130,000 people living in areas of risk,"" government spokesman Alberto Nkutumula was quoted as saying by Portuguese news agency Lusa.""There is internal capacity to deal with the situation.""""March 8, 2010: At least two people have died in floods in the central Mozambican province of Sofala, reports Monday's issue of the independent daily ""O Pais"".The first victim lost his life last Thursday, when he was swept away by the waters of the swollen Buzi river. His body was then partially devoured by crocodiles.The second fatality occurred on Saturday in Dondo district, when a man made the mistake of trying to swim across the Pungue river. The current swept him to his death.By Sunday, the Pungue was 2.3 metres above flood alert level at the Mafambisse sugar plantation. In this area, the river had burst its banks and spilled across the main Beira-Zimbabwe highway between Mafambisse and Tica.As the waters rise, so traffic along this stretch of the road has been gradually shut down. By Sunday only large trucks and some four wheel drive vehicles were taking the risk of driving through the flooded stretch. Even then, they required a police escort, and the National Roads Administration (ANE) took the precaution of only opening the road in one direction at a time. Queues four kilometres long built up of vehicles waiting to cross the flooded stretch.Minibus taxis can no longer make the journey, and so passengers anxious to reach the other side are paying bicycle owners to carry them. The fare charged by these ""bicycle-taxis"" is 100 meticais (about 3.5 US dollars).Since Saturday, a goods train has been ferrying stranded light vehicles between Mafambisse and Tica. The railway runs parallel to the road, but is high enough to ensure that it is not affected by the flood waters.200 families at risk, who were temporarily sheltered at a primary school, have now been moved to a resettlement area at Tica, where over 100 plots of land are available for them to build new homes.According to Joao Ribeiro, general director of the country's relief agency, the National Disasters Management Institute (INGC), the situation is under control. However, there may still be people living on islands in the rivers and in other flood prone areas who are at serious risk. Ribeiro said that rescue teams have been formed to sweep through dangerous areas.Further north, the flood on the Zambezi is worsening, and at the weekend the Cahora Bassa dam was obliged to increase its discharges from 2,736 to 3,512 cubic metres of water per second. ....Based on UNICEF situation report, 210 families (1,050 people) have been affected by the initial inundation in Namathanda district; of these, 613 people have been evacuated to a temporary shelter located in Mufu village....March 1, 2010: ""Maputo ? The district of Buzi, in the central Mozambican province of Sofala, has been cut off from the rest of the country by flooding on the Buzi river.The ferry across the river has been out of operation for the past week, and now the road connections to Buzi town are impassable, reports Monday's issue of the Maputo daily ""Noticias"".There has also been flooding on the Metuchira river, in the neighbouring district of Nhamatanda. A bridge over the Metuchira has been damaged, and an electricity pylon has been knocked down, depriving the area of power.Sofala Provincial Governor Mauricio Vieira visited Buzi and Nhamatanda on Friday, and on Saturday met with the Provincial Emergency Commission. The meeting decided to allocate boats to Metuchira, particularly so that students who live in the Metuchira-Pita locality, but study in Nhamatanda town, can cross the river.Buzi administrator Sergio Moiane told ""Noticias"" that the situation in the district is worsening. On Friday, Vieira could travel overland to Buzi, but now the road from Beira to Buzi town, via Tica, is impassable.""Previously, we had the problem that the ferry was paralysed, and so people on the other bank, in the Estaquinha and Nova Sofala administrative posts, who account for 60 per cent of the district population, were isolated"", said Moiane. ""Now the Tica-Buzi road, which is our main access route, cannot be used"".It is still possible to take a boat from Buzi to Beira, but Moiane warned that the current bad weather is making even this difficult.Moiane said nobody is in danger of losing their lives, since people who used to live in flood prone areas were moved to resettlement sites on higher ground during the last major Buzi floods, two years ago. However many fields have been inundated, and the district administration is trying to ascertain the extent of damage to crops.Torrential rain has also been falling in the western province of Tete. The publicly-owned telecommunications company, TDM, blamed this weather for a cut in the fibre-optic cable between Moatiza and Do, near the Malawian border.This is imposing severe difficulties on the fixed and mobile phone networks, and on Internet access, in the province. TDM has pledged that its technical staff re on the ground working to repair the damage."

The INGC has responded by sending emergency teams into the Maputo suburbs, reporting back by radio every 15 minutes.Water invaded many homes, as their residents slept. Frantically, people tried to throw up barricades to divert the waters, or resorted to buckets to remove the water from their bedrooms.Thanks to Maputo's woefully inadequate drainage system, the main roads in the city have become rivers, and driving along them is hazardous. The drainage channels along the road leading to the airport have been unable to cope with such heavy rain, and have overflowed, so that the road is under several centimetres of water.25th September Avenue, the main thoroughfare running through the lowest part of the city, near the port, is completely flooded, and the shops lining the avenue have been inundated.Although, by midday, the intensity of the rain had lessened considerably, it was still falling, and the National Meteorology Institute (INAM) warned that there is a 50 per chance that it will continue raining through Wednesday night.So far it is not clear whether the same level of rain has fallen in rural parts of Maputo province. If so, then it would clearly threaten flooding on the Incomati, Umbeluzi and Maputo rivers.Indeed, the National Water Board warned on Tuesday that the Maputo river was approaching flood alert level, and advised people living nearby to remove pumps or other equipment from its banks, and not to try crossing the swollen river. January 22, 2010: The ongoing heavy-rains spell, believed to be another bout of El-Nino, seems to have this time spared the shores of Lake Balangida in Hanang District.The previous El-Nino spell in 1998 wrecked havoc on residential homes surrounding the lake in the Basotu and Katesh wards of Hanang, causing a mass exodus of people and leading to the total closure of Basotu secondary school.The local ward representative and community worker, Mama Rose Kamili stated: ""It is surprising this time there have been no floods along the lake, despite the fact that rains are falling in torrents here like in many other parts of the country.""In Katesh, the lake has remained calm as of late, with people busy harvesting soda ash, whose caked slates can be seen in a number of sacks dotting the shorelines.Mama Kamili, the area representative through the ruling CCM party, lives near the lake and a few months ago reported that people in the vicinity had started to vacate the areas near Lake Balangida after the Meteorological Department warned of imminent heavy rains that would affect the Nation.Located at the foot of Mount Hanang, Lake Balangida is a lifeline to more than 1000 fishermen and close to 5000 fish mongers and traders, with some coming from as far as Songea in Southern Tanzania and Mwanza around Lake Victoria shores"

The tourists became trapped after floods and landslides destroyed road and rail links to the famous site. Peru's Cuzco region in the Andes is the worst-hit.

The flooding along Egypt's Red Sea coast, the border with Israel and in the south left six people dead. It also damaged the roads leading to the resorts in the Sinai desert and brought down telephone and power lines. Israel temporarily closed its southern border crossings with Egypt and Jordan, while Jordanians were warned off the streets after nearly a dozen accidents in one area. Rains of this magnitude, which began Sunday night, are rare in this largely arid region and where heavy precipitation can result in sudden and deadly flash floods.

The victim's wife and two companions, a Canadian and an Indian, survived, according Maj. Gen. al-Shafei Hassan, chief of criminal investigation in the southern city of Aswan. The heavy rains also washed away a dozen mud brick homes in southern Egypt and killed two women there. Scores of families in Aboul-Rish village in Aswan slept overnight outdoors after their homes were destroyed. In the famed monument city of Luxor, just to the north, the bad weather caused power failures in several neighborhoods and disrupted Nile cruises, sailboat and ferry schedules. In neighboring Israel, a woman drowned when her car was caught in a flash flood in the south, where stormy weather also blocked the main road to the Red Sea resort of Eilat. A bridge also collapsed near a cargo crossing between Egypt and Israel. Flooding wiped out large sections of a major road in Egypt's south Sinai and destroyed two dozen homes in Ras Sudr, according to Mohammed Fayez, the head of emergency services. The heavy rains also killed one woman, left 14 missing and damaged the roof of Sharm el-Sheik's old airport, he said. President Hosni Mubarak flew to Sharm el-Sheik and inspected the damage.

The bridge carried the Central Line across River Mkondoa, which burst its banks following heavy rains lasting several days.He said the floods had destroyed three more bridges elsewhere, adding that the line had been damaged at 16 spots along the 293km stretch between Dar es Salaam and Kilosa.""The damage in all these places is severe, and major repairs are needed to normalise the situation,"" Mr Chambo said.About Sh4 billion is needed to repair the line, according to initial estimates, and the ministry has sent experts to assess the damage.Mr Chambo said the biggest task the experts and Tanzania Railways Limited (TRL) technicians were facing was restoring the natural course of River Mkondoa to allow the reconstruction of the destroyed bridge.This is the second time the Dar es Salaam-Dodoma section of the Central Line has been closed.The defunct Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) closed it for more than a year in 2006 before it was reopened in October 2007 by TRL, which took over TRC's operations three years ago.Passengers travelling between Dar es Salaam and the upcountry destinations of Mwanza and Kigoma had to make Dar es Salaam-Dodoma part of the journey by bus due to the closure.The TRL management has been grappling with liquidity problems and frequent strikes since taking over the running of the struggling railway firm.Mr Chambo also inspected the Morogoro-Kilosa road, which has been closed temporarily after floods rendered it impassable.The worst affected section is near Kimamba Township, where a bridge has been swept away, and several kilometres of the road flooded.Mr Chambo said waiting for the floodwaters to recede was the only option for both the government and people using the road.""We can't do anything at the moment because the entire area, including the road, is under water. We should wait for water levels to recede before repairs can begin.""Mr Chambo said a study had established the need for the road to be raised in the flood-prone area to make it passable at all times.He added, however, that the government was giving priority to repairs so that the road could be reopened as soon as possible.Meanwhile, over 400 people sleep in the open in Kilosa District due to lack of space in camps set up for people displaced by floods.A local government leader, Mr Zidadu Masanza, said 477 people were sleeping under trees because the camps were ""full to the brim""""We have no accommodation and as a result, men and a few children sleep in the open in biting cold,""he said.Most of those affected are from Mkondoa Village where dozens of houses have been destroyed by floodwaters that were several feet deep in some places.Mr Masanza said the number of tents provided so far was not enough, adding that displaced people were arriving at the camps in significant numbers daily.""Apart from tents, these people need other forms of relief such as food, bednets and medicines,"" he said.A total of 609 people, including 315 children, have been displaced by floodwaters that gushed through villages after River Mkondoa burst its banks last week.The relief coordinator at a camp in Kisiki Ward, Mr Mganga Msakuzi, said the floods had displaced 56 families in the area, adding that 70 people were sleeping in the open for lack of tents.Mr Msakuzi said criminals were taking advantage of the situation to steal from victims at night, and appealed for security in camps to be stepped upJanuary 5, 2010: ""The TMA said northern coastal regions like Dar es Salaam, Tanga as well as Zanzibar and Pemba islands would get normal to above normal rains, as will areas around Mount Kilimanjaro.The current Pacific build-up looks like a mild version of El Ni-o which has in the past devastated the globe, according to the United Nations weather agency.The TMA warning has come at a time when thousands of people in the country have been displaced by flash floods which have hit their districts.The most affected is Kilosa District in Morogoro Region where three people have died and more than 23,000 people have been displaced after their houses were either destroyed or surrounded by flood waters.The floods have also hit Kongwa District in Dodoma Region, parts of Ruvuma Region and Same District in Kilimanjaro Region.The Government, Red Cross Society and other organisations as well as individuals, including the MP for Kilosa, Mr Mustafa Mkulo, have been pouring in assistance to the victims, most of whom have been left without a roof over their heads.The Prime Minister's office had dispatched 42 tonnes of maize, and two trucks full of 1,000 blankets, 1,000 tents, rice, bed nets and milk for the flood victims in Kilosa.The Government has been forced to step up efforts to evict people from dangerous areas as some have been reluctant to leave their houses, despite the danger of being swept by the floods.The Morogoro regional commissioner, Mr Issa Machibya, announced that a decision was reached to temporarily turn all ward secondary schools into relief centres to accommodate and assist the victims.He had told our reporter in Kilosa that the regional administration had dispatched some assistance to the flood victims"" December 28, 2009: ""Heavy rains that pounded Dodoma and Morogoro regions during Christmas holidays left thousands of people homeless.The rains began on Christmas Day, and continued well into Boxing Day, bringing misery to hundreds of families in Kongwa and Kilosa districts in Dodoma and Morogoro regions, respectively.Thousands of people were forced to seek shelter elsewhere after their house were either swept away or flooded after a downpour lasting several hours.Flooding in Kongwa killed at least one person, whose body was found floating in a swollen river on Saturday. The body had not been identified by midday yesterday.District officials yesterday confirmed that 14 houses had been washed away in one village alone.Kongwa District Commissioner Lembris Kipuyo said at least 12 families had been given temporary shelter by the district administration after their house were either destroyed or badly damaged in the downpour.He said the decision to evacuate the residents was reached during an emergency meeting of the district disaster committee.""These people had no roofs over their heads after their houses were either washed away or damaged to the extent of being uninhabitable they have been offered temporary shelter elsewhere,""he said.Mr Kipuyo said large areas were under water, and the belongings of those who fled their homes could be seen floating on the floodwaters.The district disaster committee in collaboration with Red Cross Tanzania had since Saturday been busy providing the evacuees with relief supplies, including food and mosquito nets.""We have also supplied them with anti-malaria drugs and water treatment chemicals to prevent an outbreak of malaria and water-borne diseases,"" Mr Kipuyo said.In Kilosa, over 10 houses were swept away and at least 500 others flooded by a relentless downpour.The situation worsened after the swollen River Mkondo burst its banks, causing torrents of water to gush into human settlements.Kilosa District Council executive officer Ephraim Kalimalwendo said roads and other infrastructures were likely to suffer major damage as a result of the floods.He said the level of River Mkondo had risen by almost a metre due to heavy rains in catchment areas in Dodoma Region, adding that the situation was likely to get worse before it got any better.Mr Kalimalwendo said, however, that there were no reports of loss of life, adding that his office was working to establish the extent of the damage.Meanwhile, people displaced by the floods appealed for humanitarian assistance from the government.They also called for the speedy construction of the proposed Kidete Dam to prevent flooding in the area.Mr Kalimalwendo said district authorities were finalising plans to award a tender for the construction of the dam. The project was initiated by area MP Mustafa Mkulo, who is also the Finance and Economic Affairs minister.Morogoro Regional Commissioner Issa Machibya visited the victims and consoled them. He said the government would work closely with local authorities to extend assistance where necessary.""We have already been in touch with the Tanzania People's Defence Forces, who have agreed to supply tents to those whose houses have been destroyed. The Red Cross will also assist in the humanitarian effort,"" he said.Early last week, flash floods swept several bridges and culverts along the Babati-Arusha highway, paralysing transport.For nearly 36 hours from Tuesday midnight the road was rendered impassable to motorised traffic.It was not until around 11am on Wednesday that all types of vehicles were cleared to move on after restoration of the road network by the Chinese engineers constructing the Minjingu-Babati portion of the highway.At Mawe Maro, the entire lowland was flooded following torrential rains. At Matufa the road stretch was covered by mud, sand and debris from the adjacent hills.According to the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), Babati station registered 50mm of rain on Tuesday, the highest recorded in the country for the day.The rains paralysed transport between Arusha and Babati as well as to the central and Lake Zone regions.Buses heading to Arusha on Wednesday from Manyara, Dodoma, Singida and western regions could not make it to the tourist town until midnight or early Thursday."

November 20, 2009: ""Parts of Scotland and northern England were under several feet of water Friday morning after raging rivers burst their banks and flooded towns, officials said.A police officer was missing after flooding in Cumbria, near the border with Scotland, Cumbria police said Friday. An earlier report that 11 people were missing was incorrect, a police spokesman said.The Cumbria town of Cockermouth was one of the worst hit. The Georgian market town sits at the junction of two rivers, the Cocker and the Derwent, which raged overnight and flooded the town center.The waters were so strong at times that rescuers could not send their boats against the flow to reach trapped residents, witnesses said.Two bridges in Workington, about seven miles east of Cockermouth, collapsed because of the floods, Cumbria police said. Engineers are trying to assess bridges for structural damage, though the work is difficult while the waters remain high, police said.Witnesses said the nearby town of Keswick, about 10 miles to the southeast of Cockermouth, was also badly hit.The Fire Service and Royal Air Force evacuated about 200 people by helicopter from Cockermouth's main street and town square, both cut off by the floodwaters, Cumbria police said.Police advised against all non-essential travel in Cumbria because many roads are closed and impassable.Several reception centers were set up at schools and leisure centers for residents forced from their homes, the police said.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke with Cumbria's chief constable Friday morning and promised him any government help he needs, Brown's office at Downing Street said.""His thoughts are with all those who have been impacted by the floods and our thanks go to the emergency services, who continue their extraordinary efforts to help those affected,"" a statement from his office said.Environment Secretary Hilary Benn was in Cumbria on Friday to assess a government response, Downing Street said.There were no deaths reported from the floods, which began Thursday after heavy rain swept over the region.One of the largest recorded totals was in Seathwaite, about 20 miles south of Cockermouth, known for being one of the wettest places in the United Kingdom. About 14.6 inches (372 millimeters) of rain fell there between Wednesday night and 4 a.m. Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday), said forecaster Robin Thwaytes of the Met Office weather service.""It's a phenomenal amount of rain to come down in such a short period of time,"" he said.Bad weather was forecast to continue across the United Kingdom over the next few days, with more heavy rain and gale-force winds bringing the continued risk of flooding, the Met Office said...""Raging floods engulfed northern England's picturesque Lake District on Friday following the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in Britain, killing a police officer and trapping dozens in their swamped homes.Military helicopters winched dozens of people to safety and emergency workers in bright orange inflatable boats rescued scores more after an unprecedented deluge.British soldiers conducted house-to-house searches for those trapped by floods as deep as 8 feet (2.5 meters). Troops also dropped down on lines from Royal Air Force helicopters, breaking through rooftops to pluck people to safety.Constable Bill Barker, 44, died as he joined rescue attempts, swept into the surging waters when a major bridge collapsed. Emergency services said more than 200 people were rescued in the hardest-hit town, Cockermouth and about 1,000 homes were flooded.In a message to local officials, Queen Elizabeth II said she was ""deeply concerned and saddened by the dreadful flooding across Britain."" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Barker ""was a very heroic, very brave man.""Britain's Met Office said a record 12.3 inches (314.4 millimeter) of rain fell in 24 hours in the area - the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in the U.K.Cockermouth, a market town 330 miles (530 kilometers) northwest of London, lies at the junction of the Cocker and Derwent rivers and is known as the birthplace of poet William Wordsworth. The flood was ""of biblical proportions,"" local House of Commons lawmaker Tony Cunningham said.Heavy rain and gales also brought widespread flooding to Ireland, as more than 3 feet (1 meter) of water shut down the center of the country's second-largest city, Cork, and more than a dozen towns and villages. The Irish army was used to rescue the stranded from waist-deep floodwaters and a helicopter winched to safety a County Galway family of five, including the 87-year-old grandmother.Floods caused transport chaos along Ireland's western coast. At the Lake Hotel, on the shores of the fabled Killarney Lakes in County Kerry, about 170 guests at the Victorian period building were evacuated by tractor, as staff carried period furniture upstairs.Irish weather forecasting service Met Eireann said parts of southern and western Ireland suffered their most intense and sustained rainfall in 30 years"

Lopez Mendoza said the toll included a family of four ? two adults and two children ? who were killed when a mudslide buried their home Sunday morning.The remaining victims were buried by slides or carried away by raging rivers in other parts of the country, Vice Interior Minister Ernesto Zelayandia told .El Salvador was slammed by three days of heavy rains from a Pacific coast low-pressure system indirectly related to Hurricane Ida, which brushed the Mexican resort of Cancun Sunday and steamed into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane.The mountains in El Salvador quickly funneled rain down into populated valleys. Poverty and precarious construction appeared to play a role in the destruction, as homes clinging to steep hillsides quickly fell prey to mudslides.Authorities had to use helicopters to reach some of the most severely affected townships, Centeno said.Centeno said it has been impossible to reach many of the affected areas because of damage to roads.Hurricane Ida's presence in the western Caribbean may have played a role in drawing a Pacific low-pressure system toward El Salvador, causing the rains, said Dave Roberts, a Navy hurricane specialist at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.He added, however, that ""if there were deaths associated with this rainfall amount in El Salvador, I would not link it to Ida."""

The World Health Organisation says 1.43 million people, mostly in and around Manila, continue to endure a dangerous existence living in flooded districts.Those areas may remain flooded for months because chaotic urban planning has led to natural drainage systems along lakes being blocked.

But although foreign governments and international aid agencies have provided crucial aid, less than a third of a UN appeal for $74 million has been raised.Amid the immediate relief concerns, the government is also having to grapple with longer-term reconstruction efforts. One of the main concerns is that too many people, particularly slum dwellers, in Manila have been allowed to live in flood-prone areas.A government report last week called for 2.7 million people in shantytowns to be moved from ""danger zones"" alongside riverbanks, lakes and sewers. The plan would affect one in five Manila residents and take 10 years and P130 billion ($2.77 billion) to implement.

In some areas, the floodwaters have not receded.This has caused many people to fall ill of leptospirosis, an infectious disease caused by exposure to dirty, stagnant water.To lessen the incidence of the disease, Duque said authorities had declared an outbreak of the disease in three districts of the capital and were administering antibiotics to some 1.3 million people.""It will provide substantial protection,"" he said.

H V Parashwanath of Karnataka?s disaster monitoring agency in the provincial capital Bangalore said.?There is death and destruction all around us,? senior provincial minister Basavaraj Bommai said, adding that large tracts of agricultural land including sugar cane and paddy fields were inundated, likely to cause hardship for poor farmers when the water recedes.Scores of military helicopters dropped food and drinking water to thousands of marooned villages and hundreds of naval divers rescued people trapped in swirling floodwaters.Army soldiers used boats to ferry villagers stranded on rooftops to government schools or relief camps on higher ground but facilities there were poor and overcrowded.More than 700 relief centres had been set up in the contiguous states to accommodate nearly 500,000 homeless people, a number barely enough to accommodate the numbers flocking to them.Personnel from India?s National Disaster Response Force were also deployed and officials said hundreds of doctors were labouring to halt the outbreak of disease.?We are deploying medical teams in the affected areas to prevent the occurrence of epidemics,? S Subramanyam, special commissioner for disaster management in Andhra Pradesh?s capital Hyderabad, said.And though the rain lessened somewhat yesterday, flooding worsened after authorities released water from rain-swollen reservoirs and dams in both states to prevent them from bursting their banks and wreaking further havoc.Karnataka chief minister B S Yeddyurappa, who ordered an aerial survey of the flooded region, has asked the federal administration for $2 billion dollars in aid to help rebuild homes and provide basic relief to those affected.Ironically, a fortnight earlier parts of the flood-ravaged regions were suffering severe drought following insufficient monsoon rains.Weather officials said an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal had triggered the devastating downpour.However, environmentalists said global warming and climate change were responsible for both the drought and the unseasonal rain, and they urged the government and the international community to implement remedial measures swiftly."

Some had scrawled giant SOS messages on bits of broken timber ? one or two with estimates of the number of dead beneath the mudslides.Added to the misery has been mounting condemnation of the handling of the disaster by the authorities. Newspaper editorials accused Taiwan?s president, Ma Ying-jeou of being incompetent, and carried reports of survivors digging, unaided, in search of loved ones. One survivor said: ?We are forgotten.?Much of the anger is directed at the Government?s failure to seek foreign assistance from countries such as Japan or the United States, a reluctance thought to be born of stubborn pride.Mr Ma's inspection of the relief efforts was interrupted when he was surrounded by a group of enraged survivors. ?What is your Government doing?? one man shouted at the President. ?It?s too late, they cannot be saved.?Thousands have been found alive in remote mountain villages ? including another group of 300 discovered stranded this morning ? but reaching them is difficult. Even helicopter airlifts have been hampered by the bad weather, with the number of evacuations lower than expected.Estimates vary wildly over how many people might still be alive, and, more grimly, how many may lie crushed under thousands of tonnes of collapsed mountainside. The official toll stands at 108, though there is a strong suspicion among rescue workers that the figure could triple as the search goes on.The Government sent another 4,000 troops to join the 16,000 already deployed throughout the flood-stricken disaster zone. Liao Liao-yi, the Interior Minister, spent the day denying suggestions that the relief effort had been lacklustre, assuring reporters that the pace had picked up from yesterday.To those waiting at the heliports on the edge of the disaster zone, however, progress again felt painfully slow. Bridges have been obliterated and many roads have either been buried under landslides or smashed off the mountains. In the area around Taoyuan, the authorities warned that other flood-lakes could burst at any moment.None of this has calmed the anger of the villagers waiting impatiently for news of their families.

Minor flooding also hit at least nine other communities. The floods resulted from a rare combination of unusually heavy winter snow and a spring warm-up over the past week that saw temperatures soar into the 70s -- a good 20 degrees higher than normal for this time of year. National Weather Service forecasters said temperatures have dropped to seasonably cool levels and are likely to stay that way for the next week or so, which they say could ease some of the flooding.One of the hardest-hit waterways has been the Yukon River. At 2,300 miles long, it is Alaska's lengthiest river. Melting snow in the Yukon's Canadian headwaters poured more water than normal into the river.

Swelled rivers that have flooded homes to their rooftops and forced more than 260,000 people from their homes in northeastern Brazil will probably take a few more weeks to recede, Brazilian authorities said over the weekend.The intense flooding has paralyzed large swaths of this sweltering tropical region, where schools and government buildings have been closed for weeks and whole towns are almost underwater. While water levels have receded somewhat in recent days, showers continued through the weekend. That further complicated the timeline for the drenched areas to dry out and for residents to return to their homes. With only marginal assistance arriving from the federal government, local authorities in some of Brazil?s poorest states say they are at the breaking point. ?The water level is not dropping fast enough,? said Jƒnio de Sousa Freitas, the mayor of Trizidela do Vale, one of the worst-hit towns. ?We are facing a critical situation. We don?t have the resources to cope with the heavy demand for basic goods, from food to medicines to mattresses.?The flooding, which began in April, has been the third-worst in the past 49 years, based on the amount of rainfall in a single month, said Lincoln Muniz Alves, a climatologist in S?o Paulo for the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies.It is the second time in six months that intense flooding has turned into a regional disaster. In November, torrential rains in Santa Catarina, in the south, caused landslides that left 135 people dead and swept more than 78,000 from their homes, affecting some 60 towns.?What we are observing in the last few years in Brazil is a pattern of droughts and more intense rains,? said Carlos Nobre, a climatologist in S?o Paulo at the National Institute of Space Research.Colder temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, which climatologists have called the La Ni¤a effect, are colliding with warmer temperatures in the tropical southern Atlantic Ocean, one possible explanation for the extreme weather patterns, he said.Heavy rains continue to force more people from their homes.

""""May 14:Thousands of Brazilians returned home yesterday following devastating floods but water kept on rising in some places and civil defence officials used helicopters, trucks and boats to deliver aid to victims in isolated communities.The death toll dropped from 42 to 39. The number of homeless decreased from 300,000 to 267,000 as residents headed home in some of the 11 states affected by the floods - an area more than five times the size of New Zealand. But waters were still rising in some places and authorities warned that the situation remained a threat because the weather forecast calls for more downpours.A major aid effort was still under way, with civil defence officials delivering food and drinking water to isolated communities surrounded by muddy water and newly formed lakes.Flood victims gathered around helicopters dropping off aid in the hard-hit state of Maranhao, and Globo TV showed images of people living on the roofs of homes inundated with water because they feared looters would strike if they headed to shelters.Rain was still falling in some parts of the zone stretching from the Amazon to normally dry northeastern Brazil, which has experienced its worst flooding in at least two decades. Meteorologists have blamed the rainfall that led to the floods on an Atlantic Ocean weather system that usually moves on in March but didn't budge this year.Water was still rising yesterday in sprawling Amazonas state, and low-lying parts of the jungle city of Manaus were flooding as the mighty Rio Negro river that feeds the Amazon approached a record set in 1953.""

May 8: ""Northern Brazil's worst floods in decades have driven 218,000 people from their homes to seek refuge wherever they can, packing onto flatbed trucks and braving rivers teeming with deadly reptiles in a scramble for higher ground. Already, 36 people have been killed in the flooding, sparked by unusually heavy rains that have been falling for two months on 10 of Brazil's 26 states. Three times the size of Alaska, the affected area stretches from the normally wet rainforest to coastal states known for lengthy droughts. Meteorologists blame an Atlantic Ocean weather system that typically moves on by April and they forecast weeks more of the same....Some shelters were already packed with people, pets and livestock, and had little food or medical supplies.
